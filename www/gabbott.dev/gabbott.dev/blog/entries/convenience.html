<h1>Convenience</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
This will only be a quick one. 
<p>

<p>
I wonder, to what extent is inconvenience a bad thing? Is it bad at all? And
what inconvenience should be tolerated, and what not? 
</p>

<p>
I am thinking this as I have recently come into need of a lot of cardboard, for
covering over the allotment with, and been mulling over just buying it in. For
now, I have been collecting cardboard every time I go to the shops, and have
been asking people around me to "donate" whatever cardboard they have. So far
it has worked out well, and I have a decent amount, but it certainly would have
been more convenient to just buy a whole load of cardboard. So is the
inconvenience worth the cost?
</p>

<p>
I suppose there is an argument to be made that I have benefitted from the
inconvenience. My attention span might be longer because of it, say. And of
course, by recycling other people's cardboard I have found, I have saved it
from being chucked away, whilst also saving new cardboard from needing to be
produced to that amount that I used. That is a good thing, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
But how far does this apply? Is inconvenience always good? Or is it sometimes
bad? What if the effect on the environment wasn't there? Or if any positive
effects generally were so small as to be unnoticeable? Would there still be
benefit in inconvenience over convenience? Or is a balance necessary - I don't
buy all my own clothes, nor produce all my own food, and it would be
inconvenient to the point of impossible to do so. 
</p>

<p>
Not sure really. Not looking for answers exactly, just wondering. I would
probably side that generally, inconvenience is beneficial. But certainly I do
not apply that to all things, and know it is not feasible to do so either. I
guess it is similar to whether to use low-level languages and high-level
languages, or generally what I wrote in <a

Middle Way</a> as well.
