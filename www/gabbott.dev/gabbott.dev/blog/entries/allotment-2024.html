<h1>Plans for the Allotment in 2024</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
To set out my plans for the allotment in 2024 - this will be a working document
and so will get changed over time.
</p>

<h2>The Beds</h2>
<p>I (will) have at the allotment -</p>
<ul>
	<li>berry bed</li>
	<li>failed parsnip and failed turnips patches</li>
	<li>leek bed</li>
	<li>tarp bed</li>
	<li>three bees</li>
	<li>long bed</li>
	<li>the two circle beds</li>
	<li>six planters</li>
	<li>flower bed</li>
	<li>various hanging baskets around the place</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of these, the circle beds and the flower bed (obviously) will be dedicated to
growing (mostly) ornamental flowers, and the rest can be dedicated to crops.
</p>

<h2>Crops to Grow</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Celeriac - never tried it, would like to.</li>
	<li>Kohlrabi - never tried it, would like to.</li>
	<li>Strawberries - lots of them, in the hanging baskets</li>
	<li>Rhubarb - we have a plant at home, but I wouldn't mind a second
		one.</li>
	<li>Tomatoes - Golden Sunrise definitely. Maybe some black tomatoes as
		well.</li>
	<li>Leeks - a personal favourite.</li>
	<li>Globe and Jerusalem artichokes - never tried them.</li>
	<li>Turnips - I'll try again. But twice now my turnips have failed to
		germinate. Apparently they're "easy".</li>
	<li>Parsnips - see turnips.</li>
	<li>Carrots - maybe try Purple Dragon again. Maybe Blanche a Collet
		Vert as well, as well as more traditional orange carrots, e.g.
		Nantes. They taste disgusting when bought from the shops now,
		so I would want some of my own.
		</li>
	<li>Radishes - only for successional sowing, I don't actually like
		them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flowers I want to grow</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Borage - very pretty and bees like it apparently. Will be good to try.</li>
	<li>Calendula - again, they should self-seed themselves.</li>
	<li>Zinnia - both <em>Purple Prince</em> again and <em>Old
			Mexico</em>.</li>
	<li>Gaillardia - I sowed these twice this year and none of them came
		up. I will try again, I do want to get to see them.</li>
	<li>Rudbeckias - they're pretty.</li>
	<li>Amaranthus - <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em> of course, but also
		<em>Celosia</em>. I will see if I can save any seed from the
		Celosia I have this year.</li>
	<li>Nasturtiums - definitely. They taste good too!</li>
	<li>Daffodils - for borders and the like.</li>
	<li>Hyacinths - <em>Gypsy Queen</em> and <em>Midnight Mystic</em>.
		Probably in pots.</li>
	<li>Lillies - I have <a
		href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/flowering-bulbs/lily-bulbs/lily-pollen-free-collection_mh10872">
			various lillies on order</a> for next year, and might
		also get a <em>Pretty Woman</em> or <em>Picasso</em> (I like
		the freckles on Picasso).
	</li>
	<li>Crocus - <a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/flowering-bulbs/all/crocus-jumbo-bulbs-orange-monarch_MH-23492">
			this</a> might be pretty.</li>
	<li>Choisya - potentially. It really depends if I have anywhere to put
		it, as it can't really move from when it is planted. But it
		would be pretty. I imagine near the pond could be nice.
	</li>
	<li>Salvia - I might choose some red and some blue.</li>
	<li>Hydrangea - <em>if I can</em>. I would like to grow both 
		<a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/shrubs/hydrangea-plants/hydrangea-macrophylla-plant-blaue-donau-blue-danube_MH-35430">
		Blue Danube</a> and 
		<a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/shrubs/flowering-shrubs/summer/hydrangea-macrophylla-plant-miss-saori_MH-29294">
		Miss Saori</a>. But where will I find the space...? I think I
		will probably have to give this a miss until I can find a place 
		to put it.</li>
	<li>Gardenia - perhaps? But I will need to find ericaceous soil.</li>
	<li>Foxgloves</li>
	<li>Snowdrops</li>
	<li>Comfrey - for use as fertiliser.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flower Bed</h2>
<p>
The flower bed has a few perennials already in it, namely - an armeria, two
fuchsias (Snowcap and Alice Hoffman - are they hardy? will they overwinter?),
gaura, lavender, some mint. As well, there are two hollyhock which need to stay
there until next year to flower - a nigra, and a Creme de Cassis.
</p>

<p>
In this bed, I want a gradual progression, from vivid, fiery reds, to oranges
and yellows to whites, and then back to blues, along from left to right.

<h2>Others to Consider</h2>
<ul>
	<li>For the circle bed - 
	<a
		href="https://www.therange.co.uk/garden/seeds-bulbs-and-propagation/seeds/flower-seeds/pack-of-infrared-f1-sunflower-seeds">Infrared
		F1 Sunflowers</a>. Note they are F1 so seed-saving is impossible. And do I want F1s in the allotment?
	</li>
	<li>Also potentially for the circle bed - 
	<a href="https://www.therange.co.uk/garden/seeds-bulbs-and-propagation/seeds/flower-seeds/pack-of-gazania-sunshine-mixed">Gazania</a>
	</li>
	<li>Nasturtium - <a href="https://www.therange.co.uk/garden/seeds-bulbs-and-propagation/seeds/flower-seeds/pack-of-salmon-baby-nasturtium-flower-seeds">Salmon Baby</a>
	</li>
	<li>Poppy - <a href="https://www.therange.co.uk/garden/seeds-bulbs-and-propagation/seeds/flower-seeds/poppy-paeony-lilac-pompom">
		Paeony Lilac Pompom</a> - really pretty, so maybe in the circle bed
		or in a pot somewhere?
	</li>
	<li>Dianthus - <a href="https://www.therange.co.uk/garden/seeds-bulbs-and-propagation/seeds/flower-seeds/dianthus-chinensis-chianti">
		Chinensis Chianti</a> is really pretty but 35cm so medium
	height. <a href="https://www.therange.co.uk/garden/seeds-bulbs-and-propagation/seeds/flower-seeds/dianthus-hollandia-purple-crown">
		Hollandia Purple Crown</a> is a bit taller and different but still
		pretty. Maybe again one to consider, but where do I put this?
		It is very different to other flowers in its colour.
	</li>
</ul>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>Strawberries</h2>
<p>I need to consider where I can put hanging baskets for strawberries, and
what varieties then to grow.
</p>
<p>
I would like to grow both summer-bearing and ever-bearing varieties, so I can
get an even mix of strawberries, some in summer and some throughout the year.
</p>

<h2>Varieties</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Murano - definitely do NOT grow this. It is the suoermarket
	variety, and does not taste very good at all.
	</li>
	<li>Honeoye - of course.</li>
	<li>Cambridge Favourite</li>
	<li>Flamenco - an ever-bearing variety.</li>
	<li>Toscana - ever-bearing, but note it is an F1. Again, do I want
		F1s? Of course I won't save seeds from this, so can just keep
		runners if I want to propagate.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for placing, I can have two hanging baskets (at least) above the berry
bed. One above the leek bed. Several along the path running along three bees
and the tarp bed. Several in the sitting area. Some by the pond. Maybe some by
the shed. Basically, I am not going to run low on places to put them. I can put
them above any bed, so that when I water the hanging basket, it runs off into
the bed.
</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>Long Bed</h2>
<p>
In the long bed, I have the lily (<em>Bright Joy</em>) that will stay there.
The leeks, tomatoes, and peppers will not stay after winter. The chilli might
overwinter, but I will get rid of some, or move them elsewhere. The
strawverries will stay. But that means I have almost the full section of the
bed in which to put... whatever I want, except for the little bit with the
strawberries.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end with the lily, I might give it some space. I have chard there
at present, and might instead have some leeks, or carrots growing there.
Something I can put in a neat orderly way and which grows underground. 
</p>

<p>
Then, after two rows of these carrots or leeks, we can begin tomatoes. I want
to have more tomatoes, and will dedicate a large section of the allotment to
these tomatoes. I can have two places in which to put the tomatoes to separate
out and prevent blight. Hence, the failed turnip patch would be another good
place to put them. The tomatoes will stay there the whole year, really.
</p>

<p>After the tomatoes, I will still have a bit of space at the end. What do I
do with it? Well, some of that will be occupied by the strawberries, but the
rest will be able to be used. Perhaps onions when they are to go in, so around
March. I will probably try onions from seed if I can.
</p>
