<h1>Plans for the Allotment in 2024</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
To set out my plans for the allotment in 2024 - this will be a working document
and so will get changed over time.
</p>

<h2>The Beds</h2>
<p>I (will) have at the allotment -</p>
<ul>
	<li>berry bed</li>
	<li>failed parsnip and failed turnips patches</li>
	<li>leek bed</li>
	<li>tarp bed</li>
	<li>three bees</li>
	<li>long bed</li>
	<li>the two circle beds</li>
	<li>six planters</li>
	<li>flower bed</li>
	<li>various hanging baskets around the place</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of these, the circle beds and the flower bed (obviously) will be dedicated to
growing (mostly) ornamental flowers, and the rest can be dedicated to crops.
</p>

<h2>Crops to Grow</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Celeriac - never tried it, would like to.</li>
	<li>Kohlrabi - never tried it, would like to.</li>
	<li>Strawberries - lots of them, in the hanging baskets</li>
	<li>Rhubarb - we have a plant at home, but I wouldn't mind a second
		one.</li>
	<li>Tomatoes - Golden Sunrise definitely. Maybe some black tomatoes as
		well.</li>
	<li>Leeks - a personal favourite.</li>
	<li>Globe and Jerusalem artichokes - never tried them.</li>
	<li>Turnips - I'll try again. But twice now my turnips have failed to
		germinate. Apparently they're "easy".</li>
	<li>Parsnips - see turnips.</li>
	<li>Carrots - maybe try Purple Dragon again. Maybe Blanche a Collet
		Vert as well, as well as more traditional orange carrots, e.g.
		Nantes. They taste disgusting when bought from the shops now,
		so I would want some of my own.
		</li>
	<li>Radishes - only for successional sowing, I don't actually like
		them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flowers I want to grow</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Borage - very pretty and bees like it apparently. Will be good to try.</li>
	<li>Calendula - again, they should self-seed themselves.</li>
	<li>Zinnia - both <em>Purple Prince</em> again and <em>Old
			Mexico</em>.</li>
	<li>Gaillardia - I sowed these twice this year and none of them came
		up. I will try again, I do want to get to see them.</li>
	<li>Rudbeckias - they're pretty.</li>
	<li>Amaranthus - <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em> of course, but also
		<em>Celosia</em>. I will see if I can save any seed from the
		Celosia I have this year.</li>
	<li>Nasturtiums - definitely. They taste good too!</li>
	<li>Daffodils - for borders and the like.</li>
	<li>Hyacinths - <em>Gypsy Queen</em> and <em>Midnight Mystic</em>.
		Probably in pots.</li>
	<li>Lillies - I have <a
		href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/flowering-bulbs/lily-bulbs/lily-pollen-free-collection_mh10872">
			various lillies on order</a> for next year, and might
		also get a <em>Pretty Woman</em> or <em>Picasso</em> (I like
		the freckles on Picasso).
	</li>
	<li>Crocus - <a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/flowering-bulbs/all/crocus-jumbo-bulbs-orange-monarch_MH-23492">
			this</a> might be pretty.</li>
	<li>Choisya - potentially. It really depends if I have anywhere to put
		it, as it can't really move from when it is planted. But it
		would be pretty. I imagine near the pond could be nice.
	</li>
	<li>Salvia - I might choose some red and some blue.</li>
	<li>Hydrangea - <em>if I can</em>. I would like to grow both 
		<a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/shrubs/hydrangea-plants/hydrangea-macrophylla-plant-blaue-donau-blue-danube_MH-35430">
		Blue Danube</a> and 
		<a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/flower-plants/shrubs/flowering-shrubs/summer/hydrangea-macrophylla-plant-miss-saori_MH-29294">
		Miss Saori</a>. But where will I find the space...? I think I
		will probably have to give this a miss until I can find a place 
		to put it.</li>
</ul>
