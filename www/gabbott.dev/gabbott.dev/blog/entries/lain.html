<h1>Notes whilst watching Serial Experiments Lain</h1>
<p>
I haven't watched anime for a good while now, two years or so probably. I
figure I should get around to watching the classics. And in the theme of Web
1.0, I figure I ought to finally get around to watching Serial Experiments
Lain. These are just notes I've taken as I watch the episodes. Nothing of
substance really. I apologise if I break out into Japanese a little, it comes
more naturally to me when I am watching anime.
</p>

<body>
<h2>Episode 1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Ok, I can see why this is popular with the old internet crowd. The
		professor is teaching C, printf and all that. And the OS is literally
		called "C OS". 
	</li>
	<li>The computer speaks that you! That's cool in a way.</li>
	<li>Wow, her mother literally does not care when Lain says she got a mail
		from a girl who killed herself. I get why they did it in the show, as
		parents maybe don't care about the tech stuff, but surely at least one
		part of it would surprise her?
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Buckytubes - I never knew that name for carbon nanotubes! I guess we've
		had this idea for a while now. I wonder if this ever come to
		fruition.
	</li>
	<li>The densen is a recurrent theme... I can see why.</li>
	<li>Copland OS - this is a real OS apparently, but was never commercially
		released.</li>
	<li>You're that scattered god's... The Wired and the real world... minna wa
		tsunagatte iru no yo...
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 3</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the intro, the episode is Psyche - but the voice-over said
		differently. I don't know what it said.
	</li>
	<li>Betsu ni ii kazoku ni mieta wake janai kedo, Ryoushin wa futari inai
		tte koto mezurashii yo ne? Asa kaette kita kedo, okaasan.
	</li>
	<li>
		The `psyche` as a processor...
	</li>
	<li>
		Otousan no henji hen da na. Shiranai tte.
	</li>
	<li>The Psyche attaches to the motherboard, and intercepts the processor.
		Interesting. Not sure what it is still. Not just an extra processor...
	</li>
	<li>
		Hen na hito ga Rein no ie ni tsuite kitto story ni dai imi ga aru to
		omou. Wired no hito da to omou.
	</li>
</ul>


<h2>Episode 4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Worries on Layer Zero-Four?</li>
	<li>Wakai ningyo no you na musume Rein no sokkuri?</li>
	<li>Hacker Heavens</li>
	<li>Sono wakai musume, sokkuri janai. Zenzen nitenai.</li>
	<li>She's taken apart her computer, but it still works? </li>
	<li>JJ, Phantoma, an adult like you wouldn't understand, Lain...</li>
	<li>Being chased by Lain. Are you a PK as well? And wakai ningyo musume
		mata. Zenzen wakaranai, wakaranai</li>
	<li>Linked with a game of onigokko.</li>
	<li>Me ga kawatta you na: shinpai shinaide, watashi ga watashi da mono</li>
	<li>What is this assembly like script? It does look like assembly. move,
		sll (shift-left?), addu (add unsigned?), la (no clue...), lw, sw, jai
		(jump ???) It has a .text so definitely assembly of some kind. </li>
	<li>Intruder interrupted... The lines between the Wired and the real world
		are blurring?</li>
	<li>Those people in the suits are probably PK.</li>
	<li>
		I should probably call it a day here.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 5</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Accident. </li>
	<li>Roonsatou? What is that? oh, tissues</li>
	<li>Rein wa terebi ni... yogen tte</li>
	<li>Rein wa Naitsu (of the Lambda Calcalus) to hanashiteru</li>
	<li>Fulfil the Prophecy</li>
	<li>The body only exists to confirm existence... The brain is not an upper
		layer of the Wired... In that, existence in the Wired can continue
		without a body?</li>
	<li>What flows through the Wired may not just be electric - it may be a
		world. In the Wired, there may be a Kami. It may have power to affect
		the real world, in a kind of yogen: yogen wo jitsugyou seyo.</li>
	<li>Lain's sister saw herself, as from the Wired? What did Lain see there?
		In that strange form.</li>
	<li>I'm very confused.</li>
	<li>Lain at the end: kyou wa dare?</li>
	<li>The eternal outlaws (ED) - The Knights?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 6</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Lain is with the Knights</li>
	<li>Saluting the sky - Lain is in the sky! atarashii kami</li>
	<li>Rein wa Wired ni... KIDS tte iu kodomo asobi.</li>
	<li>KIDS... a Kensington experiments.. Psi... ability to bend a coin, etc.
		with the mind. KIDS collects the Psi power of all the KIDS</li>
	<li>At the end... sore wa Rein no oneesan datta yo ne?</li>
	<li>Those men again... Naitsu. "They" planted a bomb in the coolant system.
		But those men, are not Knights.</li>
	<li>If so, why would the kngihts do this? And who are these men?</li>
	<li>The Knights... are they on the side of Lain? And already, Lain is
		become God - the Knights may be working for the other man, who said he
		was God. And why is Lain's sister involved? Her sister must be in the
		Wired as well, to some extent or other. </li>

</ul>
