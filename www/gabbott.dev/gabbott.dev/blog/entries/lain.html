<h1>Notes whilst watching Serial Experiments Lain</h1>
<p>
I haven't watched anime for a good while now, two years or so probably. I
figure I should get around to watching the classics. And in the theme of Web
1.0, I figure I ought to finally get around to watching Serial Experiments
Lain. These are just notes I've taken as I watch the episodes. Nothing of
substance really. I apologise if I break out into Japanese a little, it comes
more naturally to me when I am watching anime.
</p>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<body>
<h2>Episode 1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Ok, I can see why this is popular with the old internet crowd. The
		professor is teaching C, printf and all that. And the OS is literally
		called "C OS". 
	</li>
	<li>The computer speaks that you! That's cool in a way.</li>
	<li>Wow, her mother literally does not care when Lain says she got a mail
		from a girl who killed herself. I get why they did it in the show, as
		parents maybe don't care about the tech stuff, but surely at least one
		part of it would surprise her?
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Buckytubes - I never knew that name for carbon nanotubes! I guess we've
		had this idea for a while now. I wonder if this ever come to
		fruition.
	</li>
	<li>The densen is a recurrent theme... I can see why.</li>
	<li>Copland OS - this is a real OS apparently, but was never commercially
		released.</li>
	<li>You're that scattered god's... The Wired and the real world... minna wa
		tsunagatte iru no yo...
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 3</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the intro, the episode is Psyche - but the voice-over said
		differently. I don't know what it said.
	</li>
	<li>Betsu ni ii kazoku ni mieta wake janai kedo, Ryoushin wa futari inai
		tte koto mezurashii yo ne? Asa kaette kita kedo, okaasan.
	</li>
	<li>
		The `psyche` as a processor...
	</li>
	<li>
		Otousan no henji hen da na. Shiranai tte.
	</li>
	<li>The Psyche attaches to the motherboard, and intercepts the processor.
		Interesting. Not sure what it is still. Not just an extra processor...
	</li>
	<li>
		Hen na hito ga Rein no ie ni tsuite kitto story ni dai imi ga aru to
		omou. Wired no hito da to omou.
	</li>
</ul>


<h2>Episode 4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Worries on Layer Zero-Four?</li>
	<li>Wakai ningyo no you na musume Rein no sokkuri?</li>
	<li>Hacker Heavens</li>
	<li>Sono wakai musume, sokkuri janai. Zenzen nitenai.</li>
	<li>She's taken apart her computer, but it still works? </li>
	<li>JJ, Phantoma, an adult like you wouldn't understand, Lain...</li>
	<li>Being chased by Lain. Are you a PK as well? And wakai ningyo musume
		mata. Zenzen wakaranai, wakaranai</li>
	<li>Linked with a game of onigokko.</li>
	<li>Me ga kawatta you na: shinpai shinaide, watashi ga watashi da mono</li>
	<li>What is this assembly like script? It does look like assembly. move,
		sll (shift-left?), addu (add unsigned?), la (no clue...), lw, sw, jai
		(jump ???) It has a .text so definitely assembly of some kind. </li>
	<li>Intruder interrupted... The lines between the Wired and the real world
		are blurring?</li>
	<li>Those people in the suits are probably PK.</li>
	<li>
		I should probably call it a day here.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 5</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Accident. </li>
	<li>Roonsatou? What is that? oh, tissues</li>
	<li>Rein wa terebi ni... yogen tte</li>
	<li>Rein wa Naitsu (of the Lambda Calcalus) to hanashiteru</li>
	<li>Fulfil the Prophecy</li>
	<li>The body only exists to confirm existence... The brain is not an upper
		layer of the Wired... In that, existence in the Wired can continue
		without a body?</li>
	<li>What flows through the Wired may not just be electric - it may be a
		world. In the Wired, there may be a Kami. It may have power to affect
		the real world, in a kind of yogen: yogen wo jitsugyou seyo.</li>
	<li>Lain's sister saw herself, as from the Wired? What did Lain see there?
		In that strange form.</li>
	<li>I'm very confused.</li>
	<li>Lain at the end: kyou wa dare?</li>
	<li>The eternal outlaws (ED) - The Knights?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 6</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Lain is with the Knights</li>
	<li>Saluting the sky - Lain is in the sky! atarashii kami</li>
	<li>Rein wa Wired ni... KIDS tte iu kodomo asobi.</li>
	<li>KIDS... a Kensington experiments.. Psi... ability to bend a coin, etc.
		with the mind. KIDS collects the Psi power of all the KIDS</li>
	<li>At the end... sore wa Rein no oneesan datta yo ne?</li>
	<li>Those men again... Naitsu. "They" planted a bomb in the coolant system.
		But those men, are not Knights.</li>
	<li>If so, why would the kngihts do this? And who are these men?</li>
	<li>The Knights... are they on the side of Lain? And already, Lain is
		become God - the Knights may be working for the other man, who said he
		was God. And why is Lain's sister involved? Her sister must be in the
		Wired as well, to some extent or other. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I've only just noticed. In the OP, there are what look like
		"high-society" people, men in suits, a lady in a dress with a glass of
		wine, watching Lain on a TV screen. Are these the Knights then? Who are
		they? Or is it just showing Lain on all the TV screen, and this has no
		significance?</li>
	<li> Isn't it odd that "I am losing" sounds worse than "I have lost it
	all", as the latter sentence is devalued from overuse?"</li>
	<li>What was that thing on the wall?</li>
	<li>That looks like Lisp on her screen at 2:50 (though it's hard to
		tell)</li>
	<li>Me and the "Me in the Wired" are becoming less and less
		attached..."</li>
	<li>Sono otoko, jibun wa kamisama da tte sengen shita otoko da yo ne?</li>
	<li>That funny structure again! Like a pincer. </li>
	<li>Kondo wa nani wo shite asobun dai? - Geemu da! Kodomo no asobu yatsu ka
		na?</li>
	<li>What language is that? <code>if (!open(DB, $file) { &amp;error()
			}</code> it has ampersands in odd places, $ for variables but onlu
		sometimes, no semicolons, occasionally bits of HTML...</li>
	<li>So, the housewife is a member of Knights I assume. The kamisama man
		wants to join knights. And Lain (real world) and Lain (Wired) are
		different. 
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 8</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Whoa! I didn't except something indecent to feature in this show! But
		then again, I guess it is the <strike>internet</strike> Wired after
		all.
	</li>
	<li>6th gen IP protocol? 7th gen? Is this a real thing.</li>
	<li>zenzen ugoiteinai, ryoushin</li>
	<li>ugoita!! mitsumeteiru, Rein wo. Chotto kodou wakaranai ga</li>
	<li>Aa, minna sou. Wired no Lain to Jissai no Lain mattaku chigau hito ni
		natta kara, Wired no Lain no yaru mono wa Lain ni zenzen kankei nai
		kedo kekka aru mitai.</li>
	<li>Another you has existed in the Wired... So there is "Real", "Nikutai
		Wired", and "Kami" versions of Lain. There are three Lains?
	</li>
	<li>So there is a Lain which is the part of Lain expelled from herself.. is
		this the persona on the Wired? That is different from the real self? 
	</li>
	<li>And now the Real Lain has deleted the knowledge from everyone else of
		being seen by Lain... so has affected the real world? </li>
	<li>But in turn, has deleted herself? This third Lain now. It's all so
		confusing.</li>
	<li>Copland OS - product by Tachibana Enterprises? Like the Tachibana
		lab?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Alien? So then, because uwasa has become fact - the alien became real. 
	</li>
	<li>Letter? Psyche?</li>
	<li>You aren't the Lain I wanted to go out with... so this is a different
		Lain, the Wired Lain</li>
	<li>Multiple Lains in Wired, only one in real life.. and change the
		memories of the people in the club</li>
	<li>And what's happening with Lain's sister?</li>
	<li>It's not me, but I knew the data coming into JJ's place had this kind
		of effect. - that was mentioned earlier. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Psyche - non volatile memory.</li>
	<li>One truth into a reality. To make... Wired?</li>
	<li>Myu-myu?</li>
	<li>Xanadu</li>
	<li>Is that image of Xanadu not unlike what the Knights logo is like?</li>
	<li>Honmono no kazoku janai... This introduction to her family, that is as
		she must be adopted? I'm you, so I wouldn't know... </li>
	<li>Wireless network for human resonance inserted into 7th gen protocol...
		but, we're only on 6th protocol? So this is the 7th gen protocol. I'm
		really confused if I am honest.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 10</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Machigatta. Sono hito datta yo. Jibun ni kamisama wo yobu hito. You're
		dead aren't you? Is this the man who made the network? Chisa said it.
		Lain is saying she caused the protocol to evolve - but as Eiri Masami -
		so Lain is the form Eiri is taking. The Knights are the worshippers of
		Eiri, in the form Lain.
	</li>
	<li>You no longer need a body, Lain... | sonna no uso da!</li>
	<li>Lain no longer has a desk - no body? Is that not Chisa that was
		there?</li>
	<li>Alisu said, you're not needed in the real world.
	</li>
	<li>That bundle of wires is on her house it seems. A consequence of her
		developing the pc.</li>
	<li>I wasn't given permission... so this was set up. She was adopted. So
		what was her household?</li>
	<li>So was it a test to lose a person into the Wired?</li>
	<li>They've used the network long before the Wired was born... referencing
		I guess that they Knights of the Lambda Calculus were in the 60s I
		believe, and before the Internet.</li>
	<li>So the Knights have been leaked. They are all being killed. The mum,
		the fat hikikomori, etc. They worshipped the Kami, which was Lain, but
		also Eiri, to some extent.
	</li>
	<li>The Wired can't be a world unto itself, only a field that functions as
		a sub-system reinforcing the real world. Those men are working against
		Eiri, and rewriting the IPv7 code.</li>
	<li>Did they choose version 6 because of IPv6?</li>
	<li>That man with the long hair, must be Eiri.</li>
	<li>Lain was born in the Wired...? Which came first, Wired or real Lain?</li>
	<li>The Wired Lain is rejecting Eiri... And the breaking of the densen...
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 11</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Infornography - new word.</li>
	<li>Linking oneself up with the Navi - overflowing with information.</li>
	<li>Software with a body. I wonder if we are all in some sense that? Well,
		the hardware is the software</li>
	<li>Chisa and Lain... are they the same idea? Software - not in need of a
		body. Are they both the same?</li>
	<li>So. I'm confused. Which Lain is which? And what's happening with Alisu.
		Which Lain told Alisu's secret. I am lost.
	</li>
	<li>There are two more episodes. I'm going to call it here today.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 12</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I don't think I remembered to put this yesterday, but the soundtrack
		yesterday, during the first half, the review, was sick.</li>
	<li>Two episodes left. I was really confused last episode - hopefully these
		two will help me.</li>
	<li>There weren't exactly multiple Lains, but that each Lain was the Lain
		inside others memories.</li>
	<li>Rein wo suki ni narimasho!</li>
	<li>Originally people were connected to each other, and all Lain has done
		is restored this...? Confused. When were they originally connected?
		When a coherent society existed?</li>
	<li>Connecting real world to Wired without any devices. What will this
		do?</li>
	<li>Rein wa me no naka ni iru? Sore de ano otoko ga shinda? Minna
		tsunagatteru tte koto, minna nikutai wo ushinatte, Wired ni iranakucha
		naranai tte iu wake?</li>
	<li>Rein no ane? mada beep beep beep shiteiru. Nande? </li>
	<li>Confused still. So that is Kamisama (Eiri?) of the Wired, who tries to
		get a body.. but as he is not of this world, he does not succeed -
		whereas Lain, with a body (despite originally being software, she is
		now in both worlds)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Episode 13</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Before the episode starts - is Lain related to KIDS. Or not. Maybe</li>
	<li>Is this a candidate for the most uncomfortable hug ever?</li>
	<li>Fourth chair, but no Lain.</li>
	<li>All reset - Rein wa doko ni mo inai? Chisa mo mada iru. Itaitaishii
		ending da ne.</li>
	<li>Just need to re-write that record - I think the proper ending might
		happen now! With Lain. (Actually, nope.)</li>
	<li>The Wired is not created to the shared conscious - ... </li>
	<li>Lain is in the Wired, so she will be with us forever. </li>
	<li>I'm actually still confused even at the end of this show. I'm not very
		good at following things like this. It was a good show though. I will
		read up on it.
	</li>
	<li>Reading <a href="">a review</a>, 
		it mentions that it is that Lain sacrificed herself for Arisu. That
		makes somewhat of sense. It still doesn't tie everything together, and
		I feel that I knew that in a sense, without ascribing it to words -
		Lain is in the Wired, yet is with us all in another sense. I think it
		is an anime you must think deeply about to understand. I do not
		understand fully, I am rather stupid. I enjoyed it greatly nonetheless.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>Enjoyed it. I felt confused through most of it, and at the end also. But it
was really good. Not sure what score I would give it. A fairly high one. But
I'm not good at rating, so I would say somewhere between a 6 and 8 I enjoyed
it, but higher in terms of production, originality, story, etc. I think 8 is a
good middle ground.
