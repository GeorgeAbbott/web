<h1>Sleep</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<body>
<p>
One thing I'm realising is that I can't buy time from sleep. It may seem
obvious, but it still hasn't fully sunk in from me yet. I can only
<em>trade</em> time.
</p>

<p>
For instance, last night, I stayed up until late, as I had work I wanted to get
done on the laptop and the first bit of sorting out photos I took at <a
	href="https://gabbott.dev/pictures/hope">Hope</a> (there are over 500, and
it will take a long time).
</p>

<p>
So I stayed up until one. I tried to get up at six the next morning as I wanted
to go to the allotment - no luck. I woke up feeling absolutely tired, and
realised I just needed to keep on sleeping. I eventually woke up at about
twenty past eight. 
</p>

<p>
So, instead of going to bed at ten or eleven like would be sensible, I stayed
up until one. But then, I woke up in the morning, had to sleep an extra two
hours - offsetting the two or so hours I had gained, and feeling terrible for
it. I gained no time, I just felt worse.
</p>

<p>
That is the nature of the trade. I can buy hours, but they will be reaped back
- and the cost is, that I feel terrible for it. I pay a premium just to use my
hours sooner rather than later.
</p>

<p>
Whilst I don't imagine a perfectly consistent bedtime is good either, in its
restricting regularity, I will need to learn the lesson of not trying to borrow
time - it must be paid back, and with a high interest rate.
</p>
