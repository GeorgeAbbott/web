<h1>The Acquisitive Society</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
This entry is a review of the R.H. Tawney book <em>The Acquisitive
Society</em>, which I have just finished reading.
</p>

<p>
The book itself was written in 1920, but the idea is still very relevant today.
It is that we should have a society based around function, not mere capital,
and as such should organise society so as to facilitate function, product,
which is, after all, the ideal of industrialism.
</p>

<h2>Property</h2>
<p>
Tawney distinguishes between two types of property: those that are used for
productive purposes, and those that are not. For instance, a farmer in
possession of a shovel, hoe, and the like, has a form of property, but this
property is good: without it, he would not be able to work. Therefore this
property is a net positive on society. The concept of property allows the
farmer to keep these tools that allow him to do his work.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, consider shares in a company, or long lists of copyrights
held by a music label. These are non-productive: they exist only to make the
proprietor money, but do nothing otherwise in benefit of society. So these
forms of property are a net negative on society. The Communist cry to abolish
all property means losing non-productive property, which is an instrument of
power sure, but also means losing productive property as well. What we want, is
to abolish all property <em>not used towards a functional end</em>.
</p>

<p>But doesn't abolishing, and confiscating property seem immoral? Isn't it
against the property owner's rights?
</p>

<h2>Rights</h2>
<p>
The issue with rights, so Tawney, are that they are a form of power. What
rights are, is a way to say: I have the power to control your action, with the
aid of the government if necessary. So rights are a form of power - and with
power comes responsibility. Rights are <em>derived</em> from the end of the
society in which they exist, and <em>conditional</em> on being used to the
attainment of that end - they are not some absolute, inviolable thing. They are
not an end in themselves; they exist as there is good derived from them, and
only because there is good derived from them - once a right becomes detrimental
to society, it must be abolished. The responsibility of the rights-holder is to
use these rights to the benefit of greater society. 
</p>

<h2>Doing away with shareholders</h2>
<p>
So it should be obvious that shareholders are a problem, and shareholders
benefit by exactly this form of investment. They have capital, due to having
been born into money. They use this money to invest in a business, and then get
dividends, returns, on the investment that they idly made. They themselves have
no knowledge of the industries in which they invest, or the day-to-day runnings
of such industries, but merely give money, and take more money away. They
merely expropriate the returns. And the amount is enormous. Berkshire Hathaway
is sitting on nearly a trillion dollars of assets. Assuming it took $250 to
feed a person for a month (which it doesn't), this amount could feed over four
million people, for their entire lives. Basically, end world hunger. But it
doesn't. It goes to yachts and idleness. And this is only one company of many.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't mean doing away with managers. They are helpful - they know the
way things are on the ground, but also have a good enough view to make
decisions that others may not be able to make, as well as help with team
cohesion and all that. They actually contribute to the labour through their
management. But shareholders cannot make effective decisions, as they are not
well versed in the field - as such, they can only take away from the labour
produced (as they do).
</p>

<h2>The Profession</h2>
<p>
Tawney also describes the notion of a <em>profession</em>. A profession is a
line of work conducted for the greater good, and not necessarily for the
remuneration it provides. For instance, consider teachers, nurses, doctors, who
have a professional feeling towards their work. It is, in short, the work
conducted by a functional society, not an acquisitive one. All work can be a
profession if the choice for it to be conducted in that way is made - there is
no reason the builder cannot call himself a professional.
</p>

<p>
A thought that I found was interesting was how this relates to the modern
software industry. The software industry is divided between proprietary
entities, who through the laws governing the use of property (namely,
intellectual property) benefit in an immoral way. However, due to their
having benefitted in this way, they are often the richest, and so employees
must lower themselves to work for these companies. Meanwhile, the employees
spend a significant amount of their time creating projects which are of higher
quality, and which they are more passionate about, and have more of the
professional feeling - free software. Almost all major software is produced in
this way: the Linux kernel, the various OpenBSD projects (OpenBSD, OpenSSH,
OpenBGPD, OpenNTPD, OpenSMTPD, LibreSSL, ...), X, Wayland, OpenLDAP... they are
all produced in this way. And yet, since the licenses used are often permissive
not copyleft, this work is them appropriated by the capitalist, and used to
further oppress, and perpetuate the current system. Hence, the work survives,
and it becomes a profession almost as if by accident; yet how precarious is
this system? How long can it survive? 
</p>

<p>The profession gives morale, which is the <em>condition of efficiency</em>,
as Tawney calls it. This is, what in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,
would be called <em>gumption</em>. <em>Enthusiasm</em>, in the sense of being
filled with God - no wonder God is the Creator.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
I can't think of much else to write, and I'm not great at writing yet. The
conclusion is, that work should be conducted such that it can become a
profession, and in such a way where labour is not expropriated by an idle
class, such as the shareholders, who only make worse the situation for the
worker and for the consumer both, and that this can be achieved through the
abolition of those forms of property which do not have their foundation in the
production. It is Hermeticism brought to the economic sphere: that the highest
order is not rights over property, but labour and function, and that the
pursuit of labour as a profession, or, in more religious terminology, the work
of one <em>filled with God</em>, with Logos, with Quality, is the supreme way.
