<h1>New Fountain Pen: Review and Notes</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<body>
<p>
I have, over the past year, maybe year and a half, I been transitioning from
writing more on the computer to preferring to write on paper. I do not think
that writing on the computer is bad - but having to have the computer there is
a big ask as compared to just having a notepad or two on me, which I nowadays
tend to keep about my person, much as most people carry a phone about
themselves.
</p>

<p>
I have up until this point used fine liners, such as these 0.4mm ones <a 
href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/201562818834">I bought on eBay</a>, but am not
fully satisfied with them. They write well, though they do <a 
href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/205528-what-do-you-mean-by-feathering/">feather</a>
a little, and the nibs get pushed down after much writing, which results in
them not... well, being able to write. So I have to stop using them (and
basically, chuck them away) even before all the ink in them is used up, which
feels bad and is a waste of plastic. So I have decided to try for a fountain
pen instead, which is more renewable, and means less waste, and possibly a
better writing experience?
</p>

<p>
The pen I opted for, after a little research, was the <em>Wing Sung 698</em>,
which has a 0.5mm nib (good enough for me), and is a soft nib, whatever that
means. I opted for 
<a href="https://www.thewritingdesk.co.uk/ink-refills/fountain-pen-bottled-ink/pilot-iroshizuku-yama-budo-50ml.html">
Yama-Budo</a> ink from Iroshizuku - I have heard it is meant to be generally
reliable, and this ink have a pretty colour, even if it is a little expensive. 
I figure, better to go upmarket than to pay the poor man's tax. And for how
long the ink will last me (which I think will be a good while) it probably
works itself out to a similar cost to having to buy new pens for all that time. 
</p>

<p>
The ink is a lovely shade of purple. It does not fade after it has dried, but
will smudge if you get it wet - weirdly, I got some ink on my finger filling it
up, and that ink has stayed firmly put even after vigorously washing my hands,
yet a lick of the finger, and a rub over the words, causes the ink to smudge on
paper. It's strange. Either way, that's nothing unusual for a pen to smudge,
so not really an issue.
</p>

<p>
I write quite small normally - I generally write about sixteen words per line
on a side of A5, and take up half the line, which means that if I really need
to write a lot of words in little room (which happens occasionally, e.g. if I
run out of paper/my notepad is running out of pages) I can write some
thirty-two words per line of A5, give or take. Writing just single lines (not
double lines) at this size, was perfectly feasible at this size, which makes
sense - the pen is almost the same size as the one I used before. So no
troubles there.
</p>

<p>
I feel as if I might cramp a little more than normal, but really, that will
come with time, and once I am used to the pen I feel that will stop happening.
</p>

<p>
Overall? Really impressed. Just from my first-day impressions, I would highly
recommend it. A few months down the line, when the ink is drying, or spills
all over my shirt, or whatever other mayhem, I may eat these words though...
</p>

<h2>Update: 2023-10-08</h2>
<p>
It's only been a few days, but I'm having all sorts of trouble already. So much
for <em>a few months down the line</em>. The pen keeps spilling. I'm not sure
if it is nib creep, but the ink come about of the breather hole. It seems to
happen when I've used enough in to create a bit of a gap in the chamber, but
not sure. I tried creating that situation once, and it did not happen. Then I
tried to refill it, let a few drops out, and for some reason it happened then.
I just don't understand...
</p>

<p>
It might be an issue with the pen, or it might be an issue with the ink. I will
get a new pen and some different (perhaps, thicker) ink, and see if that helps.
I guess this is how one falls into a rabbit hole.
