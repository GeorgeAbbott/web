<h1>The Problem of Multiple Moral Quandries</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<body>
<p>
I recently read a blog post by <a
href="https://idiomdrottning.org/non-vegans">Idiomdrottning</a>, saying that
though they used to be a strict vegan, they no longer consider this to be the
most important issue, and instead are more concerned with fossil fuels,
plastics, and reducing their consumption of it. Whilst I would not believe the
two to be at all mutually exclusive, I can understand the argument, and even
somewhat agree with it. Not all animal agriculture is bad -- certainly
industrial agriculture is abhorrent, but pasture-fed cows and sheep, the kind
you see out of a train window, are not all that bad -- especially in comparison
to the permanent damage caused by fossil fuels and plastics.
</p>

<p>
Now saying this, I am a hypocrite. I expend little thought on the issue of
plastic, and though I do, e.g. refuse to drive a car due to the environmental
damage (alongside the fact that cars are a large 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_de_Kindermoord">source of death in cities</a>,
and cause horrible 
<a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=CTV-wwszGw8">noise pollution</a>
and generally work against the idea of a livable city), I barely think when I
pick up items from the supermarket wrapped head-to-toe in plastic (cucumbers
are a particularly egregious example).
</p>

<p>
Now, I would call this my <em>sin</em>, in that, it is an action I know I ought
to take, yet do not. I do not yet have the visceral emotion on the topic, the
in-set knowledge (what on the internet would be called being
<em>red-pilled</em>), enough to act, or even particularly research it further.
I am as the meat-eater who <em>knows</em> that industrial farming is wrong, yet
does not fully <em>understand</em> it yet. Or the vegan who knows that
industrial agriculture is immoral, yet is too comfortable to disavow that
system yet.
</p>

<p>
Talking to a friend about this, he brought up an interesting point. I call it
<em>sin</em>, but there are always immoral matters of which we partake. I may
abstain from meat, from plastic, yet what of slavery? In this case then, I must
not use anything produced in China then, invariably by under-paid workers or
<strike>slaves in concentration camps</strike> 
<a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=YYOKMUTTDdA">Shiny Happy People</a>
in re-education facilities. To buy battery technology is to buy cobalt - 
<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr62/3183/2016/en/">
mined by impoverished children in the Congo
</a>, and to buy clothes is to buy the labour of 
<a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=pTIfY9SmJdA">eleven-year-old girls in
Bangladesh</a> and the like. We never banned slavery; we out-sourced it.
</p>

<p>
So, what to do? And there are more issues beyond just those three. In fact, is
it not my responsibility to attempt to reduce evils, even if <em>I</em> do not
partake? Should I not campaign and raise awareness for veganism? Should I not
also do the same for fossil fuels and plastics? And slavery? Or raise awareness
of the evils of rape, or murder, or war, which we all content ourselves to know
are bad, but never actively fight against them. I know I should. So am I not
sinful in view of all this?
</p>

<p>
It reminds me of the problem with the 
<a href="https://daily-philosophy.com/peter-singers-drowning-child/">
drowning child</a>, where the situation gradually becomes more and more difficult.
If I see a drowning child, of course I am morally obliged to help it. If I see
two, or I have a nice shirt on, that doesn't change the answer. But at what
point does it become unreasonable? At what point do I have to say, look, sucks
for you that you've got to drown and die, but I've got to buy some spaghetti
for my dinner tonight?
</p>

<p>
I don't know. I would argue there is a distinction between <em>harm I
cause</em>, and <em>harm I can prevent</em>. If I buy meat, I am actively
<em>causing</em> the death of that animal. They only kill to give supply, and
they only supply where there is demand. With plastic, it is more difficult, as
I often do not get a choice in the supermarket between plastic-free and
plastic-smothered, but arguably I could buy elsewhere, e.g. a farmer's market
(though I think the nearest to me is a good hour away by bike), and thereby
circumvent the issue. As for slavery it is a similar thing as well -- I pay for
it to happen -- to the extent I pay for it, it is my fault. As for rape and
murder, I (think I) don't pay for this to happen, so they simply needn't be on
my conscience.
</p>

<p>
This is still difficult though. Just these three -- animal abuse, fossil fuels,
and slavery -- would touch almost all products I consume. I feel as if I am a
man, haunted by the idea that with every action he takes a child dies - and yet
this is somewhat true, to an extent - and is the blame on me for that? Is it
reasonable, or even possibly, even just to tackle just these three issues?
</p>

<p>
To an extent, yes. As for animal abuse, I simply needn't partake in that
system, simple enough. As for plastic, if I can't avoid it, I guess just
<em>buy less</em>. Just as veganism is still immoral but is <em>better</em>
than meat-eating, buying <em>less</em> plastic is still better than doing
nothing at all. As for slavery, avoid buying, e.g. batteries and other
slavery-tech, and make sure only to get second-hand clothes from the charity
shop.
</p>

<p>
This does not stop the harm, but it does reduce it. I don't know what more can
be done in this respect though. To a certain extent, my individual actions are
limited. What evil I do commit, I could try offset, with donations to charity
and the like, but <em>two</em> things have to occur for a man to be good: he
must be a good man, and then be <em>allowed</em> to be good. At present, I am
not a good man, so my first task is to improve myself, and my lacking moral
conduct in these regards. Where I cannot reasonably do the right course of
action, I can try to offset my evil. But that is no sin of mine - the sin is
where I know I <em>could</em> do good, yet choose to do evil. I needn't have
that on my conscience. Now of course, it would be good to try to change the
state of affairs so that I can do good, but that would be <em>harm I can
prevent</em>, not harm I (albeit indirectly, via delegation) <em>cause</em>. I
needn't have that on my conscience yet, and should instead simply work on
myself, and try not to cause what harm I currently do.
</p>

<p>
I think this makes sense, but I don't know, really. Likely not. The
<em>Metapyhsics of Quality</em> says that all things emerge of morals, but I
don't understand what that means yet. For now, I guess the above might suffice.
