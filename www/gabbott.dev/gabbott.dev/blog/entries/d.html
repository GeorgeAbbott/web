<h1>D is what C++ could have been</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
(Note: this is quite uninformed. I have only been researching D, and have not
actually used it yet properly. I will write a full review of D once I have used
it a bit.)
</p>

<p>
Both C++ and D started out with the aim of being a better C, bringing more
modern features to the C language. But D has done such a better job of it than
C++ it looks like.
</p>

<p>
C++ has regular revisions with new features - in C++20 (only recently!) the
language got modules (though no compiler implements them yet) and in C++23 they
only just got the <code>print</code> function! A nice reprieve from
<code>std::cout &lt;&lt; my_string &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code>. But how long has
it taken to get even these incredibly basic things?
</p>

<p>
D has all of this, and more. The nice features of C - templates, C-like
syntax and interop, everything, all there. If you want GC, it's there - or
don't, and use the C based <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> functions,
though sadly this won't call the ctors/dtors like C++ <code>new</code> and
<code>delete</code>. Modules? Already got 'em. UTF-8 strings? D has them. UFCS?
D has it. A distinction between in and out parameters, as opposed to using
<code>const std::string&amp;</code> all the time? D has it.
</p>

<p>
Essentially, D is a better C++. It is actually a bit simpler, too, compared
with the mess that is C++ lvalues and rvalue references and xvalues and the
hundreds of abbreviations. 
</p>

<p>
I think I will give D a try in a project sometime, and see how it fares.
Really, the only thing C++ has over it is maturity, it seems to me.
