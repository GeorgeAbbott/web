<h1>Small Review of the Go Programming Language</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
I have recently been using Go for a project I am working for at work. My usage
is only fairly light, and I have to say I am not using too many of the more
complex features, but this is just some of the things that stand out to me
after some light usage.
</p>

<h2 label="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>
Syntactically Go is alright. The <code>name Type</code> order, as opposed to 
<code>Type name</code> is much better, though I would personally prefer
<code>name: Type</code> as in Rust. Generics with <code>[T]</code> is a great 
idea and I really wish other languages would have used this syntax instead, as
opposed to <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> that we see in most other languages. 
</p>

<p>
I do have a slight gripe with the fact that lines have to end in a comma or 
something like that, otherwise the preprocessor sticks a semicolon in and 
causes an error, which is never just <code>lines must end in a comma</code> but
is always some more ugly error message. 
</p>

<h2 label="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>
For my use case, Go is plenty fast enough, and the GC doesn't cause me any
issues. 
</p>

<h2 label="issue-1-any-does-not-implement-comparable">
	<code class="h2">any</code> does not implement <code class="h2">comparable</code></h2>
<p>
An issue that bit me is this: <code>any</code> (or <code>interface{}</code>)
can be compared, but does not implement <code>comparable</code>. For instance,
this code:
</p>

<textarea cols="59" rows="10" readonly class="codeblock">
func cmp[T comparable](a, b T) bool {
	return a == b
}

func main() {
	var x any = 10
	var y any = 10
	fmt.Printf("%v == %v =&gt; %v", x, y, cmp(x, y))
}
</textarea>

<p>does not work, giving the error <code>any does not implement
comparable</code>. But, 
</p>

<textarea cols="59", rows="6" readonly class="codeblock">
func main() {
	var x any = 10
	var y any = 10
	fmt.Printf("%v == %v =&gt; %v", x, y, x == y)
}
</textarea>

<p>
works just fine. Why? The best answer seems to be that <code>any</code>
might be a type such as <code>[]int</code> which cannot be compared. If you
compare two <code>any</code> variables that are actually <code>[]int</code>
underneath, your program will panic at runtime. But for generics, instead of
consistent behaviour, it just refuses to compile. 
</p>
<p>(As an aside, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/EMM4fzG11">here</a> is a
Godbolt link if you want to try this yourself.)
</p>

<p>
There is an issue detailling this decision 
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51257">here</a>, 
the upshot of which is that they are going to keep it this way for the
foreseeable future, but might make it work in the future. </p>

<h2>Enums</h2>
<p>Go doesn't have enums, which is stupid. The best equivalent is to declare a
type alias and then a bunch of constants, all in the global namespace mind you.
I don't understand why. Even C has enums!
</p>

<h2>Lack of Sum Types, and Error Handling</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, Go does not have sum types. This is a frustrating loss. Even
worse is the choice of error handling: instead of Rust style
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, Go returns a second value, <code>error</code>,
which means you have to remember to check the error with:
</p>

<textarea readonly rows="5" cols="29" class="codeblock">
val, err := function()
if err != nil {
	// handle the error
}
</textarea>

<p>
The problem of course being that you have to <em>remember</em> to handle the 
error. As well, the if block is ugly, and takes up a lot of space.
