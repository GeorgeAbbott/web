<h1>Lights along the Greenway</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->

<p>
I went along the greenway today, and saw that it was closed, due to them
putting lights along it. I initially was a bit disturbed by it - I can
understand wanting to make it lighter, but at the same time, it is
<em>good</em> that the greenway is dark at night - the entire rest of the town
is lit up extremely bright (the light pollution here is, like most cities,
terrible). So the dark greenway gives foxes, bats, and other nocturnal animals
some actual darkness, and generally helps what little nature we have in this
city.
</p>

<p>
Doing a little research on it, it seems the lights are going to be "smart", or
basically, will have a sensor, and will only light up when people are walking
up to it. They are also solar powered, so they don't use any electricity
(though, the lithium, etc. in the battery more than offsets any good thoughts
environmentally, so it's not like it's going to be better as carbon goes.) I
think this is a good compromise though - it appeases the fears of crime in the
darkness, but also won't make the already terrible light pollution situation
even worse. That said, it will depend on implementation, so let's wait and see.
</p>

<p>
Well done, Southend Council. I think this is the first time I've ever been even
slightly impressed by them.
