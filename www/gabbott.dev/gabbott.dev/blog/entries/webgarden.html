<h1>Blog, or webgarden?</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<body>
<p>
It is not uncommon to see people create digital gardens, as opposed to the idea
of a blog. A blog is chronological - it is one entry after another, and a focus
is put on the date of publishing. There is an expectation - not one that
necessarily needs to be upheld, but a tendency at least - that a post won't be
edited (except for some extra footnotes, etc.) after the initial publishing.
</p>

<p>And thinking about it - is there beauty in a blog? I don't really think so.
I have read <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/">
this</a>, about how the blog broke the web, by creating uniformity - all
websites now are chronological, because of one piece of software. But I do
handcraft my HTML. I could do anything with it - why do I stick to the
plainest, most boring, standard, unimaginative structure possible? I could do
<em>anything</em>. Well, if I have the HTML/CSS/JS skills for it (which I
don't, to be honest.)
</p>

<p>
One idea that I have, which will take ages to implement, but would be cool, is
to have the blog in the form of an actual garden. So make a little game where
the user can move about in a square grid in a garden, interact with different
flowers, and each of these tells a story - the entries of the blog.
</p>

<p>
Until that is implemented though (and it would take ages. I don't know the
first thing about JavaScript. Maybe I could write it in C++ using WebAssembly?
I think it still requires some JS as glue code, but hopefully not much), I
could of course just do the simple thing: get rid of the dates. I could just
organise everything as a big list. I think I might do that. If I did that, I
should keep the old style as well for phone users or people who don't want to
run JS/WASM/etc. I would also want to keep an RSS feed going, so I could have
the garden and the regular blog (just a mirror of the garden in more boring
form.)
</p>

<p>
I also need to make it easier for myself to just put short messages up on the
website, so I have some medium that isn't a blog post. I was thinking a domain
<a href="https://gabbott.dev/inconseq">/inconseq</a>, for <em>inconsequential
thoughts</em>, but maybe just mix them in with the blog entries.
