<h1>Initial Impressions of the Tern Link D7i</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<body>
<p>
I recently bought myself a Tern Link D7i (granted second-hand), and have since
taken it out on a little bit of a ride - I have gotten it for taking it on the
train for work. Here is my initial impressions, albeit only after one fairly
short (20 minute) bike ride.
</p>

<h2>General Performance</h2>
<p>
It is perfectly fine to ride on normal terrain - perhaps it requires a little
more effort, and a fair bit more to kick off, but generally, it is not too bad
at all. Where the extra effort really shows is uphills - uphill routes that on
my normal bike would not tire me out at all properly ache my legs on the Tern,
owing likely to the smaller wheels and heavier weight. It's not a major deal,
but perhaps this bike is best for flatter terrain, where you are less likely to
feel the extra effort you need to put in.
</p>

<p>
The turning point is interesting - it is a lot sharper (again, I imagine due to
the smaller wheels) than a normal bike. It's not like it's so sudden that you
will accidentally swerve when riding, but it does take some getting used to. I
kind of like this though - once I've gotten used to it, it will mean that I can
make much sharper turns, and not need to countersteer into my turns so much.
</p>

<h2>Folding</h2>
<p>
I haven't folded it too much yet so will update it with time, but it seems to
fold alright. It is a bit bigger than I thought it would be when folded, but
likely not an issue. 
</p>

<h2>Internal Gear Hub</h2>
<p>
Owing to the internal gear hub (the <em>i</em> in <em>D7i</em>) the bike is
lovely to switch gears. With a derailleur the other bike gives me all sorts of
problems, requires maintenance, sometimes doesn't fully switch gears or
requires an extra turn of the crack, etc. On this bike, it seems to just work,
which is nice. 
</p>

<h2>Carrying</h2>
<p>
I might get used to this with time, but carrying this bike is a right pain. It
is too heavy to be able to conveniently carry it about. I guess I just need to
go to the gym a bit more? But really, this bike is not the easiest to lug
about. The good thing is, you can wheel it along the floor when it is folded,
even if that is a little awkward (as your hand will be very low).
</p>

<h2>On the train</h2>
<p>
Not really done this yet, so I will update once I have.
</p>

<h2>Other Quirks</h2>
<p>The brakes are a lot stronger than on my other bike, so I have to be careful
not to apply too much pressure to the front brake, otherwise I will go
arse-over-tit. Also, the chain makes a horrible noise when not pedalling, but
maybe that is something that a little TLC can fix. Hopefully it's not
permanent...
