<h1>Initial Impressions of the Tern Link D7i</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<body>
<p>
I recently bought myself a Tern Link D7i (granted second-hand), and have since
taken it out on a little bit of a ride - I have gotten it for taking it on the
train for work. Here is my initial impressions, albeit only after one fairly
short (20 minute) bike ride.
</p>

<h2>General Performance</h2>
<p>
It is perfectly fine to ride on normal terrain - perhaps it requires a little
more effort, and a fair bit more to kick off, but generally, it is not too bad
at all. Where the extra effort really shows is uphills - uphill routes that on
my normal bike would not tire me out at all properly ache my legs on the Tern,
owing likely to the smaller wheels and heavier weight. It's not a major deal,
but perhaps this bike is best for flatter terrain, where you are less likely to
feel the extra effort you need to put in.
</p>

<p>
The turning point is interesting - it is a lot sharper (again, I imagine due to
the smaller wheels) than a normal bike. It's not like it's so sudden that you
will accidentally swerve when riding, but it does take some getting used to. I
kind of like this though - once I've gotten used to it, it will mean that I can
make much sharper turns, and not need to countersteer into my turns so much.
</p>

<h2>Folding</h2>
<p>
I haven't folded it too much yet so will update it with time, but it seems to
fold alright. It is a bit bigger than I thought it would be when folded, but
likely not an issue. 
</p>

<h2>Internal Gear Hub</h2>
<p>
Owing to the internal gear hub (the <em>i</em> in <em>D7i</em>) the bike is
lovely to switch gears. With a derailleur the other bike gives me all sorts of
problems, requires maintenance, sometimes doesn't fully switch gears or
requires an extra turn of the crack, etc. On this bike, it seems to just work,
which is nice.
</p>

<h2>Carrying</h2>
<p>
I might get used to this with time, but carrying this bike is a right pain. It
is too heavy to be able to conveniently carry it about. I guess I just need to
go to the gym a bit more? But really, this bike is not the easiest to lug
about. The good thing is, you can wheel it along the floor when it is folded,
even if that is a little awkward (as your hand will be very low).
</p>

<h2>On the train</h2>
<p>
I have now carried this on the train to work, and have discovered: yep, it's a
lot more inconvenient than I thought. Now, first things first, getting to ride
to work is a downright wonderful experience, and, even if my ride to work is
only a mile, so about ten minutes to the station. 
</p>

<p>
The folding is quickish, once you get used to it, though it does come apart if
you don't wrap the cable hooks around the frame of the bike. To keep it on the
train, you really need to do a few extra steps above and beyond the manual:
take down the stem/handlebars, bring the saddle down, fold it up as per
instructions, but then also wrap the cable ties round (I do it twice, once
round the frame and a second round the tyre), latch on the stem using the
little hook-strip provided to stop it dangling, and then lock the bike itself
to the bar in the train.
</p>

<p>
Carrying it is painful, so best to try to walk it as much as possible. When
folded, you can wheel it, but it is not just difficult because it is so far
down (sort of similar to holding a young child's hand, you could get back pain
after being hunched over like that for too long), but also, it loses its centre
of gravity with a pannier bag attached, and doesn't keep its balance. So best
to have it unfolded and wheel it.
</p>

<p>
Carrying it up and down the stairs at the station was, again, painful. Then
also having to carry it up the stairs at my workplace, painful. I ended up
folding it again and shoving it under my desk, but it only barely didn't fit
when upright, so I had it on its side (which felt a little cruel to the poor
machine) shoved far enough under my desk for it not to catch on my feet under
the table.
</p>

<p>
Generally, I notice that, with its 20 in wheels, it is a lot bigger, and
therefore more inconvenient, than expected. For instance, getting through doors
is a challenge, because the bike is pretty much the width of the door. It means
you have to do a very awkward manoeuveur, made all the more unpleasant by the
weight of the thing, to be able to get through.
</p>

<p>
I think putting it under the desk is a bad idea. As said, it's so big it's
unwieldy to carry about, especially in human-sized places such as an office.
Frankly, it is probably best to find a bike shed and park it there if your work
offers one. I can't remember whether mine does - I will ask tomorrow.
</p>

<h2>Other Quirks</h2>
<p>The brakes are a lot stronger than on my other bike, so I have to be careful
not to apply too much pressure to the front brake, otherwise I will go
arse-over-tit. Also, the chain makes a horrible noise when not pedalling, but
maybe that is something that a little TLC can fix. Hopefully it's not
permanent...
</p>

<p>
Talking of going arse-over-tit: I went on a nighttime ride with my dad, where
he took my old bike with the lights, and I took the new bike, but didn't have
any lights. Well, the results? Predictable! I drove into a pothole I couldn't
see, as I had no visibility in front of me at all without the lights (we went
down a path without street lights), and off the bike was I. I keep on
mentioning the tyre size, but I think with 27 in tyres, the bike could probably
have survived that pothole. But mine didn't. Oh well, lesson learnt - though
the lesson is probably to just actually use lights, especially when going down
a path that makes a darkroom look like midday in comparison.
</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>
Overall, I guess I enjoy it. But beforehand, I think I had a very myopic
viewpoint: I will get to ride to work, and ride straight from work to the
allotment or to wherever else, and I didn't consider the reality of having to
fold and unfold a bike, and lug it about, which is much less glamorous. But the
ride is incredible, truly incredible, getting to do a route that I am so used
to, but in such incredible speed (well, 6 mph on average I guess) that maybe it
makes up for the unsexy stuff around it? Who knows. I will keep on trying it,
and see if it gets better. But at present, it's not like its any better or
worse than walking, and I could see myself just not being in the mood for the
hassle of the bike, and just walking instead. Simpler is sometimes better, I
guess.
