<h1>It's Always Money</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
I'm really beginning to get fed up, lately, of all the talk of money,
constantly, consistently, ceaselessly continuing.
</p>

<p>
Companies speak of money, and returns, and even, god forbid, 
<a href="https://gabbott.dev/blog/entries/the-acquisitive-society">shareholders</a>.
That's bad enough, though I guess they're obliged to. But I do some
research, and I want to get some ideas for what to do with the website - I
found the idea of a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now</a> page
recently, and have since <a href="https://gabbott.dev/now">added one to my
website as well</a> - I think it's a really good idea! But then, I look for
other ideas, and what do I find?
</p>

<p>The search engine gives some to resist immediately. <em>53 website ideas to
make money in 2023</em> - no thanks! I have more interesting matters to attend
to. <em>30+ Most Succesful Website Ideas to Make Money in 2023</em> - is this 
déjà vu? No wait, it's actually a different website, an altogether different
article! <em>25 unique website ideas for your next side project in 2023</em> -
why always 2023..? Anyways, this one doesn't mention money! Hold on, let's just
read the description quick...
</p>

<q> Learn how to build and launch a website that can help you generate extra
	revenue online. Whether you want to monetize content, sell products, or
	learn something new, <code>$GODAWFUL_SITE_DOT_COM</code> has you covered
	with 25 unique website ideas for your next side project in 2023.
</q>

<p>
Revenue, monetize, sell... Always, always, money! Is there nothing more
interesting? Wasn't money meant to be the proxy to value, not the value itself?
Are the means confused for the ends here?
</p>

<p>And it's still always in 2023! These ideas, strictly for use hoc anno.</p>

<p>And of course, even if you find one where the description isn't of this
form, what words can you expect to find on the topic? Well, it's those familiar
words: SEO-optimized, audience, monetization, affiliate, marketing, business,
enterpreneurial, (e)commerce, sales, sell, product, solution, income, SaaS, and
all the rest.
</p>

<p>
Look. If you want to make money, fine. I can understand. But please, keep it to
yourselves. Is there no shame in these people's minds, that all they do, all
they talk about, is their sin, their greed, their desire, their thirst for
money, and all the false indirections and abstractions they conjure up for
these purposes? Do they not repose of an evening, and see what they've become?
What they speak of? I suppose men were made to be servants to ideas. There's 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea_of_the_Good">a really good idea</a>
they could try serving, but I guess it's only one of many, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
I'm fed up with it. I presume it's a citydweller's condition. Shoot me if I
ever become like that. I just wanted to find some good ideas for the website,
but I guess the takeaway has to be I'm not making enough money.
</p>
