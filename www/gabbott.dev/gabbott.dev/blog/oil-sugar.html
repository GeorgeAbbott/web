<h1>Refraining from Oil and Sugar</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>I am thinking of refraining from oil and sugar going forwards.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
Aside from the obvious health problems with oil and sugar (we are of course
talking table sugar here, not natural sugars in fruit and the like) you could
also argue that sugar is procured immorally. Historically that was of course
the case, and I suspect (granted without evidence) that the Fairtrade
certification used to mark &ldquo;moral&rdquo; products are just meaningless
badges put over the product to make it appealing to cityites who want to feel
good, like the Red Lion, or approval from the RSPCA, and it is still very bad
today. 
</p>

<p>
So here, I will need to think about all the foods I eat of an everyday basis
which has sugar, or oil in it, and try to think of alternatives. 
</p>

<h2>Breakfast</h2>
<p>
There are three main types of foods people (and myself) eat for breakfast:
porridge, toast, and cereals.
</p>

<p>
For cereals, it's difficult to find completely sugar-free, but wheat biscuits,
e.g. Weetabix, are fairly good. Apart from that, hard to find. 
</p>

<p>
For toast, if the bread is bought from a shop, it probably has to go. Homemade
bread is probably fine though, as it generally doesn't need much sugar. For a
topping, use (homemade) jam, or perhaps peanut butter (I guess this is oil, but
it's better). 
</p>

<p>
For porridge: perfect. This is probably the best breakfast anyways. Just make
sure the milk you have doesn't have sugar added! I recommend cinnamon with it
instead of sugar.
</p>

<h2>Dinner</h2>
<p>
For a default dinner, I tend to have a kind of meat-and-two-veg meal like most
people. As for the veg, simply don't cook it in oil.  If making mash (a
mainstay), don't add butter (if vegan butter). You can still add some milk
though.
</p>

<p>
For the meat, well, I don't eat meat, but for the fake meat that I eat, there
are ways around it. The burgers and the like from the shops are going to have
to go. So, how do I get my protein, he worries? 
</p>

<p>
Well, as for real meat there is a lot else you are missing out on, but fake
meat as I eat is basically tofu. So just eat tofu. You can cook it in any old
way. Apart from that, supplement it with other things like lentils. For
instance, cook up some lentils and freeze it. 
</p>

<h2>Lunches</h2>
<p>
For lunches, potentially some beans (Heinz does some sugar-free ones) and a
baked potato. Or, some soup. These kinds of things. 
</p>

<h2>Snacks</h2>
<p>
Fruit is a good bet. 
</p>

<h2>Some common foods that now seem missed</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jam: it is best to make your own, though it is expensive.. I
		haven't tried it but apparently you can use
		apples/flaxseed/chia seed/potato as a pectin replacement, and
		do without the sugar (or use artificial sugars, but not sure
		how I feel about that.)</li>
	<li>Vegan Butter: these are just pure oil basically so have to go. I
		am not sure on a good replacement, and probably best just not
		to eat it.</li>
	<li>I'll add more when I think of them...</li>
</ul>
