<h1>Inconvenience and Low Technology</h1>
<p>
On my main machine, I have a fairly bloated install of Artix Linux. For all
what Arch-based distros are supposed to be minimal, I have somehow ended up in
a state where neofetch reports 1719 packages, many of which granted can
probably be removed, and my system is very fancy, but also very fragile. 
</p>

<p>
My editor is <code>neovim</code>. But not just neovim. I have all sorts of
LSPs and other plug-ins and whatever else, probably a lot of which I do not
really need.
</p>

<p>
I got a laptop at the end of last year, and installed Artix on it. I intended
it for working on various programming projects on-the-go, for instance on
trains or maybe at the park. It's had a variety of operating systems now on it,
from Artix, to OpenBSD, to DragonFlyBSD (which I tried out, but found annoying
to use) and then back to OpenBSD now, where I think I will stay for good. 
</p>

<p>
With this laptop, I have decided not to install anything too fancy on it. It
has <code>neovim</code>, but no LSPs, no fancy plug-ins, nothing. Just plain
old neovim with an at-the-moment
<a href="https://git.gabbott.dev/george/obsddf/src/branch/master/init.vim">
eight-line long vimrc.</a>
Similarly, I am sticking to <code>ksh</code>, and hoping I can catch some parts
of my scripts on Arch that are not POSIX-compliant. I already caught something
when I began to use <code>csh</code> on DragonFlyBSD, and found out it does not
even support functions, so I had to move all of the functions I had in my
<code>.zshrc</code> into separate script files. And with OpenBSD, I have
recently found that all my scripts that use <code>date -d</code> don't work on
BSD, as <code>-d</code> is a GNU extension. Still not sure how to work around
that, but I will figure it out. 
</p>

<p>
But the most important part is, I think by installing all these fancy-dan
tools, code completion and the like, whilst it does help at first, it also
means you <em>don't learn these things on your own</em>. If you rely on code
completion to tell you the names of the functions you want to use, then when
you don't have it, you'll be back and forth to the manpages. You get a less
complete understanding. 
</p>

<p>
I realise this in language learning as well. There are so many apps and
programs and courses and all which purport to teach you a language. Use Babbel
and it will teach you &lt;insert language here&gt; with simple (and also
useless, but they don't tell you that) sentences. But it doesn't help you in
the real world. It is painful, but a part of getting a good understanding of a
language is just to do the to-normal-people-unenjoyable bit, and sit down, and
study the grammar. Painful maybe, but where you actually learn. 
</p>

<p>
I think a similar thing applies here. If I want to get better at programming,
or at scripting, or at whatever, I just have to sit through the pain of going
"oh, what was that function called again" and remember to make notes when I do
find it to spare myself searching for it again. But the act of doing that
searching means it will really stick in my mind. 
</p>

<p>
I know a similar point was said by Jonathon Blow on 
<a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">his talk on the end of
civilisation. </a> The perk of using, say, Python over C++, or C++ over
Assembly, is that you gain efficiency. Of course we don't want to always write
everything in Assembly, it's so difficult, and we want to have code that is the
same over all architectures! And of course we don't want to have to manually
manage memory or deal with writing <code>std::unique_ptr</code> everywhere,
that's such a hassle! But the downside is, once you stop doing these things, if
you aren't careful, you will forget how to do them.
</p>

<p>
Another reason is, I find the high-tech actually gets on my nerves most of the
time. For instance, writing this, I wanted to go back to add in
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> blocks. But every
time I do this, <code>neovim</code> automatically adds in the closing block as
well, e.g. adds in the <code>&lt;/code&gt;</code>. This would normally be
helpful, but when the inner contents of the block already exists, it adds the
block <em>before</em> the contents, so I have to go delete it and retype it
after the contents. I know that I have a plug-in which has some keybinding to
add in surround blocks like this, but I can't remember the keybinding, so I'll
have to go fish through their documentation. Whereas really, I would be most
happy if it just <em>did nothing.</em> It's sometimes helpful, but just as
often a hindrance. 
</p>

<p>
It also makes me more impatient I notice. I use <code>zoxide</code>, which is
like a fancier <code>cd</code>, and remembers directories you have been to so
you can go there before. I have it aliased to <code>cd</code> for convenience.
But sometimes I type a directory, and it takes me to the wrong one! So I type 
<code>cdi</code> and find the right one, but I notice I come out considerably
more annoyed. Where in reality, if I just had the simpler, "slower"
<code>cd</code>, sure, I might have had to type out the full directory name.
But I get there either way, and I'm happier for it. 
</p>

<p>
I realise that last point was a bit of a personal one, I am not saying never to
use anything high-tech, but just to be aware of the effects. I am beginning to
think that all this high-tech comes at a high cost too. You might get better
efficiency, but this comes at the cost of skill and ability. Deeper knowledge
becomes trivia. When "features" don't work, they slow you down even more than
if you had never had them in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
Generally, it is wise to be cautious about adding more on. Can this be done
with what I already have? Do I really need this? Could a low-tech solution work
as well as this high-tech solution? If so, I think it is well worth
considering. 
</p>

<p> That's all. </p>
