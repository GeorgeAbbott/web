<h1>The Middle Way</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
In Buddhist teaching, there is a concept called the <em>middle way</em>, which
refers to taking not the path of asceticism nor the path or hedonism, but
instead a middle way, a moderate path, neither extremity. 
</p>

<p>
I believe this applies to most things in life. Neither extreme is good; always
a middle ground is best.
</p>

<p>
Below are some particular examples I think exemplify this notion. 
</p>

<h2>Computer Technology</h2>
<p>
Computer technology has improve over the years dramatically. We have gone from
processors which are measured in KHz to MHz and now GHz in less than a century,
and even now, our processors aren't just one processor, there's four or six or
twelve of them. 
</p>

<p>
As development goes, I believe for example neither to be too ascetic (real
programmers use Assembly) nor too high level (only use Python) is good.
Instead, a nice middle ground should be found: C, C++, Rust, Zig... 
</p>

<p>
And for software itself: what is best of all is software which is developed to
be relatively small: perhaps featureful for its size, but not a giant blob. It
is clear when comparing the slow and lumbering Adobe Reader with zathura, or
Visual Studio to vim, or similar things. While part of the problem is just
inherent to proprietary software, there is also the issues of trying
<em>too</em> much. Even just using a GUI over a TUI is hugely inefficient. And
sometimes a TUI is worse than a simple CLI. Simpler here is not always better -
nobody (well, probably somebody) would prefer ed over vi for instance - but
generally the middle ground, here the TUI say, is best. Even then, there are
times when a GUI is best, and times when a CLI is best. Right tool for the
right job, but often moderate is best between that. 
</p>

<p>
And as for design of programs, maybe some OOP is good. But a
<code>SingletonFactoryIocContainerManager</code> or whatever is clearly
excessive.
</p>

<h2>Farming</h2>
<p>
I saw a while ago a <em>Countryphile</em> episode, where a farmer talked about
<em>regenerative farming</em>. In my head an alarm went off, as he used a big
word (<em>regenerative</em>) which is from what I can tell generally a sign
that whatever is being spoken about is kind of... obvious. And indeed it was.
He was talking about not using too much fertiliser or pesticides, or tilling up
the soil too much, using a variety of species instead of growing the same F1
hybrid exclusively, or ... basically, don't rape the land. I, even though I
don't know much about farming, couldn't help but think that it was all kind of
obvious. He was essentially talking about farming the way that farming had been
done for thousands of years prior to this. But here it is, presented as
revolutionary with big words like <em>regenerative</em> or
<em>biodiversity</em> (lots of plants) or <em>biosequestration</em> (don't kill
all the trees) or <em>emissions reduction</em> (food that's travelled a
thousand miles is worse than local produce), and fancy scientific jargon to
complement, when really, it is something we did before we even had modern
science to begin with. 
</p>

<p>
Factory farming is the same. The impact of keeping the cow, or goat, or
chickens, is minimal. It's even potentially useful: the manure makes good
fertiliser for instance. And meat is a useful food source. Putting aside the
moral issue of whether it is moral to kill an animal altogether, it seems that
the main problem is, as with all things, the scale. We were eating meat for
thousands of years without any real issue. Yet only with factory farming has
the scale of it begun to bring with it other problems.
</p>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
Recently I have been watching a lot and reading a lot about infrastructure, for
instance the <em>Not Just Bikes</em> Youtube channel and the <em>Strong
Towns</em> write-ups. In it, they stress the importance of incremental, and
sustainable infrastructure. For instance, a design emphasising bicycles
("middle technology") is much better than a design emphasising cars ("high
technology"). This doesn't mean we can't improve on bikes at all. E-bikes are
still much better, though there are problems, e.g. with the sourcing of lithium
for the batteries. And cars are sometimes useful (though, if we also have
trains and other well invested public transport, not as much). 
</p>

<h2>Small is Beautiful</h2>
<p>
A fantastic book that is worth reading is <em>Small is Beautiful</em>, by E.F.
Schumacher. We do not just need large, hedonist, excess, nor is it good to
counter this for small, ascetic, paucity. At times the former is good and at
times the latter. More often than not, a sensible middle ground is most
desirable. As he says:
</p>
<q>
What I wish to emphasise is the <em>duality</em> of the human
requirement when it comes to the question of size: there is no single
answer. For his different purposes man needs many different structures,
both small ones and large ones, some exclusive and some comprehensive. Yet
people find it most difficult to keep two seemingly opposite necessities of
truth in their minds at the same time. They always tend to clamour for a final
solution, as if in actual life there could ever be a final solution other than
death. For constructive work, the principle task is always the restoration of
some kind of balance.
