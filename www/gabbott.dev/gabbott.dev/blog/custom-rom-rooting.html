            <p>
            A month or two ago I made the decision to install a custom ROM onto 
            my S9+ that I had bought a couple years ago. For some reason I made 
            the decision back then to buy the newest, most expensive phone, I 
            think just to try out what that peak-of-technology consumerism felt
            like. I don't think I got much out of it.
            </p>

            <p>
            The decision was based on a few things, such as wanting to get the 
            newer version of Android (as my phone was out of its update period)
            and also wanting to get rid of all the Samsung and Google spying 
            that was on my old phone, and have something that just had nice, 
            clean, FOSS software on it and none of the rest of the junk that is 
            on most smartphones nowadays.
            </p>

            <p>
            I installed LineageOS onto an old S4 Mini that I had lying around as 
            a test, and was pleasantly surprised just how easy it was. Really,
            the only steps were to unlock the bootloader (in the S4 Mini it was
            already unlocked), flash a recovery, flash the ROM and bang. Only 
            a few commands and it was up and running. I had heard before that 
            rooting involved a chance of bricking the phone, but really it was 
            such an easy process I was not sure where the worry was.
            </p>

            <p>
            I then decided I would install LineageOS (although debated a bit 
            about whether /e/OS might be better, but I am happy with my choice 
            now) onto the S9, after seeing how easy it was, and got to doing it
            after making sure I wouldn't lose access to any accounts, wouldn't 
            lose my 2FA tokens, etc. by porting everything I had onto the S4.
            It took maybe 20 minutes?
            </p>

            <p>
            I wanted to install microG on this, as the ROM did not come with it 
            by default, but realised that would involve rooting, using Xposed, 
            and all of those kinds of things. I did not really know and left it, 
            getting on with just using the new OS normally without microG, 
            and then this Christmas I decided to finally root and install 
            microG.
            </p>

            <p>
            It took a little bit more effort and research than installing the 
            ROM, but really it was easy as well. All you have to do is grab 
            the boot.img, flash it through Magisk, reinstall the boot image 
            (normally with <code>fastboot flash BOOT boot.img</code>, but that 
            did not work here, as Samsung devices do not have fastboot, so you 
            use Odin on Windows or heimdall on Linux (so I just had to run 
            <code>heimdall flash --BOOT boot.img</code> instead), and then the 
            rooting is complete. After that is just to install Riru and 
            LSPosed through Magisk (it took me a good while wondering why 
            EdXPosed was not working, before realising that newer versions of 
            Riru only work with LSPosed not EdXPosed), install the microG also 
            through Magisk, and install the FakeGApps fork by whew-inc (the 
            version in the F-Droid store does not work AFAICR).
            </p>

            <p>
            And that's it! It took me about half a day to get rooting and 
            microG to work after I got around to it, but the full process of 
            going from stock ROM to rooted, LineageOS with microG can be done 
            probably in less than an hour if you know what you are doing, and 
            doesn't take more than a day or so when you don't (like me).
            </p>

            <p>
            I want to at some point try see if I can fork CalyxOS onto the S9,
            but that is a massive task I imagine. For now, the phone works, 
            and I have learnt a thing or two about rooting. I will probably not 
            get any new phones until this one irreparably breaks, but I am happy 
            with what I have - a decent phone that does not track me for ads or 
            have any software bloat like most phones come with, but nice and 
            clean with few applications, no bloat, and as fast as the day it 
            came out the box.
            </p>

            <p>
            Ultimately I think more people should do this, especially 
            considering how easy it is, and the advantages to it in terms of 
            privacy and degoogling. I will recommend it to my family 
            when they get new phones.
            </p>
