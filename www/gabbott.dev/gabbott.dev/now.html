<h1>Now</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
The <em>now</em> section of a website is an idea by
<a href="https://sive.rs">Derek Sivers</a>,
in which you add a page to your website, entitled <em>now</em>, giving
an overview on what you are up to now. Nothing too complicated. I tend, in my
journalling, to write a <em>mer</em> - shortened down from <em>month end
review</em>, as well as a <em>yer</em> for the yearly review, in addition to my
daily diary keeping. I will consider moving the mers over to here from now on.

<h2>September 2023</h2>
<p>
I've started to read more, which I've not done as much as wanted to the past
few months. The Acquisitive Society, Longitude, The Last Man, I've been
reading, and hopefully before the end of the month <em>The Kybalion</em>. I've
also decided to, in the vein of another blog I can't remember which, start
reading Plato (finally!) - at least one book a month; I've updated the website
to better keep a track of what I read. I have decided to start writing a game
in D and SDL2, just for learning purposes, for fun not profit, and also have
begun to write up a little on a story I have wanted to write for a while now -
a basic romance between two people who work at a flower nursery. It'll probably
be terrible, but let's see how it goes. I've going to get a new fountain pen in
early October, and looking forwards to seeing how it writes, and how the
Iroshizuku ink is. If it writes really well, I may have found myself a new
interest! Apart from that, I have tended to the allotment but not got much work
done on it this month. I really ought to try get things done before the days
become too short. I'll be going to Hope Valley in Derbyshire with a friend of
mine at the end of the month, which will be enjoyable.
