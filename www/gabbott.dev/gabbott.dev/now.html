<h1>Now</h1>
<!-- bct:beg -->
<p>
The <em>now</em> section of a website is an idea by
<a href="https://sive.rs">Derek Sivers</a>,
in which you add a page to your website, entitled <em>now</em>, giving
an overview on what you are up to now. Nothing too complicated. I tend, in my
journalling, to write a <em>mer</em> - shortened down from <em>month end
review</em>, as well as a <em>yer</em> for the yearly review, in addition to my
daily diary keeping. I will consider moving the mers over to here from now on.

<h2>September 2023</h2>
<p>
I've read a fair bit this month: Longitude, The Last Man, The Acquisitive
Society, The Kybalion... I have also decided to, in the vein of another blog I
can't remember which, start reading Plato (finally!) - at least one book a
month; I've updated the website to better keep a track of what I read - it's
now all automated with scripts, and looks decently good. I have decided to
start writing a little game in D and SDL2, just for learning purposes, for fun
not profit; I also want to see if Zig can be used for anything, say, the orgd
scripts (that I don't exactly need now...). I have also begun to start to write
up a little on a story I have wanted to write for a while now - a basic romance
between two people who work at a flower nursery. It'll probably be terrible,
but we will see how it goes. I'm going to get a new fountain pen early next
month, and am looking forward to seeing how it writes, and how the Iroshizuku
ink is. If it writes really well, I may have found myself a new interest! Apart
from that, I have tended the allotment rather little. I must get it ready
before the winter comes; the days are already noticeably shorter. I did put up
one of the circle beds, and placed in it the hydrangea 'Blue Danube' and some
gypsophila elegans. The sweet peas are getting pulled up slowly, and it's
coming to the end of the year for it. We also had our holiday in the Peak
District, in Hope Valley, at the end of the month - it is a lovely place.
