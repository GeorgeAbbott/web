<h1>About Me</h1>

<center>
	<p>Hello, my name is George and this is my webpage.</p>

	<p>
	This self-intro used to be very long, now it's a bit brief and direct,
	I'll get it right at some point! 
	</p>

	<h2>General</h2>
	<p>
	I am interested in programming, languages/linguistics, and the like.
	</p>

	<h2>Programming</h2>
	<p>
	I began programming in Python, and have programming in it for some
	time. However since then my interest has shifted to lower-level
	languages. I was using C# for some time, but now mainly use C, C++, and 
	Rust which I began learning in 2021. Also I use shell for scripts on my 
	system. 
	</p>

	<p>
	I would like to learn Haskell.
	</p>

	<h2>Languages</h2>
	<p>
	I have been learning German since I was about 12 and am generally
	pretty fluent in that. I was almost learning Norwegian and Polish for a
	couple years, but got bored of them and gave them up. I can still
	remember a fair bit of Norwegian but not much of Polish. I have been
	learning Japanese for the past few years, with slow progress, and I am
	also now trying to learn Latin and possibly French, to be able to read
	older philosophical works written in Latin.
	</p>

	<h2>Other</h2>
	<p>
	I would like to get into more "real" things, like carpentry, and
	growing crops. I grew some last year (purple carrots, broccoli) though
	my broccoli didn't grow much at all, and there weren't that many
	carrots. I will learn more about it this year, I hope.
	</p>
