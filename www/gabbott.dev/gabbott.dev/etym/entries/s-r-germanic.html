            <p>
            The /s/ and /r/ phonemes in Germanic have some quite interesting 
            alternation between languages that you may not have even noticed.
            </p>

            <p>
            For instance, in German, the word to be, <i>sein</i>, is conjugated
            in the past tense with an /r/: <i>war, warst, waren</i>, but in 
            the past participle this /r/ somehow turns to an s (/z/): <i>gewesen</i>.
            And in Dutch, the same verb <i>zijn</i> cannot make up its mind: <i>ik was</i>
            becomes <i>wij waren</i> in the plural, and then the participle 
            goes back to having an s: <i>ik ben geweest</i>. In fact, the same 
            happens in English if you think about it: I <em>was</em>, but you
            <em>were</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
            A similar phenomenon happens in English. We have <i>lose</i> and 
            <i>lost</i>, but then we have the word <i>forlorn</i>. Similarly in
            Dutch, the word for lose is <i>verliezen</i>, which then somehow 
            becomes <i>verloor</i> in the past tense. But then in German, we 
            have <i>verlieren</i> and <i>verloren</i> where both have /r/. What
            is happening here?
            </p>

            <p>
            The answer lies in two important sound changes that occurred in 
            the history of Germanic - the most important here being 
            <em>Verner's Law</em>. The other one, which you may have even 
            heard of, is <em>Grimm's Law</em> (named after Jacob Grimm, who 
            is the same person who wrote the fairy tales).
            </p>

            <p>
            Grimm's Law showed a set of correspondences in sounds between 
            German (and other Germanic languages) and other Indo-European 
            languages, such as Latin and Greek for instance. For example, 
            Latin <em>p</em> corresponds a lot of the time to a Germanic 
            <em>f</em>: Latin <em>pes</em> and Greek <em>pous</em>, compared
            with English <em>foot</em>. Or Latin <em>piscis</em> compared with
            English <em>fish</em>. I'm sure if you think about it there will be 
            many more you notice.
            </p>

            <p>The full list of correspondences is quite long, but for some
            more examples:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>p -> f (as in the examples above)</li>
                <li>t -> þ (for instance, Latin <em>tres</em> and English <em>three</em>)</li>
                <li>k -> h (for instance, Latin <em>canis</em> and English <em>hound</em>)</li>
                <li>d -> t (Latin <em>decem</em> and English <em>ten</em>)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            So how does Verner's Law come into this? And how does this explain
            s and r? After all, none of these changes above feature s at all, 
            let alone r.
            </p>

            <p>
            The problem is that Grimm's Law does not explain everything. There
            are unfortunately exceptions to Grimm's Law, which causes a bit of 
            a problem for linguistics, especially those who want to appear 
            scientific: it is not really seen as good for a scientist to 
            act like his theory explains everything, when in reality he is 
            just picking and choosing the parts where his theory works and 
			using that as "evidence" that he is correct.
            </p>

            <p> 
            And so to explain these exceptions, Karl Verner came along and 
            proposed a new sound change that meant that the sounds did not 
            just change into one sound, but two! So <em>p</em> for instance 
            could change into one of /ɸ/ (f) or /β/ (v) depending on the 
            situation.
            </p>

            <p>
            The main conditioning factor for this change is stress. So in the 
            case of two very common words, for instance <em>Vater</em> and
            <em>Bruder</em> where the t or d sound ideally be the same
            according to Grimm's Law (because the PIE forms both have a /t/:
            bʰréh₂tēr (meaning brother) and ph₂tḗr (meaning father)) so as in
            the sound changes I listed above, these should both have a /þ/. But
            it is clear that the fact that the German forms have different 
            sounds - /t/ and /d/, means that they would have not both had
            a /þ/, but must have had different sounds there.
            </p>
            <p>
            As can be seen in the above PIE forms though, the stress is 
            different (in PIE, stress is marked with a acute accent). And so 
            because of this difference in stress, the resulting forms end up
            with different sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
            Where /s/ and /r/ come into it, are because Verner's Law also
            affected /s/. It is worth pointing out that /s/ was not actually 
            affected by Grimm's Law, but it is by Verner's Law. This caused 
            the /s/ sound to alternate with a /z/ sound. And the final piece 
            of the puzzle is that /z/ underwent a process called 
            <em>rhoticisation</em>, where a sound becomes rhotic, or r-like.
            And so /s/ and /r/ ended up weirdly alternating in a lot of 
            Germanic languages, causing these weird cases where <em>was</em>
            becomes <em>were</em>, or where you are <em>lost</em> in English
            but <em>verloren</em> in German.
            </p>

            <p>
            The final piece of the puzzle is a process called
            <em>levelling</em>. Languages often undergo a regularisation, where
            odd or irregular, or generally difficult to remember paradigms 
            become more regular. In fact, I am sure you can think of some 
            examples of levelling you have heard in your day-to-day life: 
            people might say they <em>swelled</em>as the past tense of
            <em>swell</em> (as opposed to <em>swoll</em>) and many examples of 
            this have occurred in say, the transition from older forms of 
            English to modern-day English: we speak of <em>cows</em> not 
            <em>kine</em>, and some are partway through transition: we may 
            varyingly say <em>octopusses</em> or <em>octopi</em>, instead of 
            <em>octopodes</em>.
            </p>

            <p> 
            So in this case, the irregular variation between s and r was 
            levelled in a lot of cases to be a <em>bit</em> more regular. 
            Taking lose as an example, in English we levelled it all to /s/
            (lose, lost) whereas in German they levelled it all to /r/ 
            (verlieren, verloren). In Dutch, they did not level it completely, 
            and ended up with the present tense <em>verliezen</em> and the 
            past tense <em>verloren</em>. A similar thing happened with all
            the other examples: in English, <em>was</em> and <em>were</em> 
            did not undergo levelling, but in German they did, yielding 
            <em>war</em> and <em>waren</em>. But the past participle in 
            German did not get levelled, giving <em>gewesen</em>.
            </p>

            <p> 
            As a side note, the commoner a word is, the less likely it is 
            to be levelled. This is because the levelled form is used more 
            often and so is more likely to be corrected.
