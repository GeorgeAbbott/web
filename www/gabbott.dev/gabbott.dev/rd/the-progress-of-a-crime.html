        <p>
        This is my first real venture into crime stories of this kind, which I 
        decided to pick up at Waterstones a year or two ago. The only other 
        crime book I've ever really read apart from this is Nisioisin's 
        <em>Decapitation</em>, which was very good, so I was hoping this was 
        going to be as good.
        </p>

        <p>Sadly it wasn't.</p>

        <p>
        I don't have a massive amount to say about this as a book though, as it 
        was just uninteresting. Not so bad it's worth talking about, just dull. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I might try and expand with some detail at some point, but that is 
        about all I've gotten from this read. I bought some others at the same
        time, e.g. <em>Fell Murder</em>, <em>Excellent Intentions</em>, 
        <em>The Murder of my Aunt</em> and <em>Deep Waters</em>, all a part of 
        the same set of murder mystery books which are British Library
        Classics. I hope when I get around to reading these they are a bit more
        interesting.
