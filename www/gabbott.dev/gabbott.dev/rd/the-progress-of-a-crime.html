        <!-- Add information here -->
        <p>
        This is my first real venture into crime stories of this kind, which I 
        decided to pick up at Waterstones a year or two ago. The only other 
        crime book I've ever really read apart from this is Nisioisin's 
        <em>Decapitation</em>, which was very good (if after the first 100 odd 
        pages which are dull), so I was hoping this was going to be as good.
        </p>

        <p>Sadly it wasn't.</p>

        <p>
        I don't have a massive amount to say about this as a book though, as it 
        was just uninteresting. Not so bad it's worth talking about, just dull. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I might try and expand with some detail at some point, but that is 
        about all I've gotten from this read. I bought some others at the same
        time, e.g. <em>Fell Murder</em>, <em>Excellent Intentions</em>, 
        <em>The Murder of my Aunt</em> and <em>Deep Waters</em>, all a part of 
        the same set of murder mystery books which are British Library
        Classics. I hope when I get around to reading these they are a bit more
        interesting.
        </p>

        <h3>Too people-focussed?</h3>
        <p>
        I wonder if I might not have liked it because it was too focussed on 
        people, and not the actual murder mystery part. And all the sort of 
        romance between the detective and whatever her name was that woman, 
        it all really just seemed to bore me. I think I would have preferred it 
        to focus on the actual mystery (though, really, there wasn't much of 
        a mystery. It's probably not murder mystery genre, just crime)
        </p>

        <h3>Nice Words</h3>
        <p>One thing to give the book props for was the many nice words, a lot 
        of which I didn't know. It's always nice to read a book and find you 
        are learning new words you could use.</p>

        <p>Some examples:</p>
        <table>
            <li>pg. 129: inveterate, acidulous</li>
            <li>pg. 131: desultory (knew, but rarely see)</li>
            <li>pg. 132: depositions</li>
            <li>pg. 133: insouciance (knew, but rarely see and is a cool word)</li>
            <li>pg. 163: unctuous mock-sorrow</li>
            <li>pg. 178: bonhomous</li>
            <li>pg. 191: histrionic</li>
            <li>pg. 205: sententious</li>
        </table>

        <h3>Odd Story at the end</h3>
        <p>There was a brief little story at the end of the book, entitled 
        <em>Tigers in Subtopia</em>. Frankly, it was a bit weird, and I am not 
        really sure what to get from it. It was about a hysterical posh woman 
        convinced that lowerclass boys have kidnapped her son, and so the 
        husband takes the law into his own hands, and spanks the boy he 
        believes responsible, only to find his son has just gone to a party and 
        his wife somehow... forgot. Not really sure what the moral is.</p>
