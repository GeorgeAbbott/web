            <p> This subdomain, <em>deu.sateoki.xyz</em>, is intended to be a 
            tutorial to help you learn German. I hope it can function as one
            more site, one more resource to help you learn, and with any luck 
            it will be this site that helps things click.
            </p>

            <p>
            I will use a teaching style similar to Tae Kim's guide to learning 
            Japanese, where I will provide vocabulary (and the gender of any
            words) with the examples, and then use this as a way to explain 
            the grammar of the language. Once the grammar is known, all that 
            needs to be done is to learn some words, and then you've got 
            yourself some fully functioning German skills right there.
            </p>

            <p>
            As such, this guide focusses heavily on the grammar, and does not 
            focus in any way on teaching you key vocabulary or anything like 
            that. That can all be learnt afterwards. 
            </p>
