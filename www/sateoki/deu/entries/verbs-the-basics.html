            <!-- Content -->
            <p> The verb is the most integral part of the sentence in any
            language - it communicates just <em>what</em> is actually being
            done. And so to start off, it is vital we learn about the verb in
            German before we begin doing anything else.

            <p>
            Whenever you go to look up a verb in German, you will see that it 
            ends in <em>en</em>. This might seem odd coming from English, but 
            really the <em>en</em> at the end of a verb can be thought of like 
            the word <em>to</em> that we always append to verbs - it marks the 
            infinitive, the uninflected form of the word when we are just using 
            it in a dictionary. <em>To think</em> is <em>denken</em>, 
            <em>to eat</em> is <em>essen</em>.
            </p>

            <p><small>
            (Even at this early stage you may notice how similar English and 
            German words are; for more information on this please consult the 
            later chapter about sounds correspondences between English and 
            German - as it turns out, they are so similar that given knowledge
            of the word in one language and just a couple of rules, you can 
            easily figure out what the word will be in the other language!)

            <p>
            A core part of German verbs is <em>conjugation</em>. We have this 
            in English as well - I eat, but he <em>eats</em>. In German though,
            verbs conjugate a bit further.
            </p>

            <h3>Conjugation: Present Tense</h3>
            <p>
            In English, there are two present tenses: <q>I run</q> and 
            <q>I am running</q>. In German, both of these forms become the 
            exact same: <q>ich renne</q>. We will detail the present tense 
            conjugation here.
