        <h1> First Blog Entry - Ideas and Whatnot </h1>

        <p>
        I have little to say here, except that this is the first entry in this 
        blog, and I can only hope that I continue. 
        </p>

        <p>
        At the moment there is still much to be worked out, but with time this
        should come to look a lot better presentationally (although I will
        never do any fancy effects with Javascript, this site will stay clean 
        and light) and I can add more entries. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        I have a couple ideas for particular subdivisions I could have for 
        different kinds of entries. Some of these are:
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th> pie.sateoki.xyz </th>
                <th>
                    For information about PIE - I have always found information
                    on Proto-Indo-European to be difficult to understand, so 
                    I would like to look into it and present it clearly.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> deu.sateoki.xyz </th>
                <th> For explaining German grammar and interesting quirks</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> jpn.sateoki.xyz </th>
                <th> Same but for Japanese grammar </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> progblog.sateoki.xyz </th>
                <th> A blog about programming and computer science </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> etym.sateoki.xyz </th>
                <th> For interesting etymologies </th>
            </tr>
        </table>


        <p>
        There will likely be more to come but for now I will work on these
        kinds of things, and add any more blog posts where I think of 
        something maybe interesting to write/read about.
