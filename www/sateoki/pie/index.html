            <!-- Add site here -->
            <p>
            The common ancestor of hundreds of other languages, including mine 
            own, is Proto-Indo-European. It is reconstructed language which 
            is not attested in anything other that the similarity between 
            modern day languages across Europe and India. It is a highly 
            interesting language...
            </p>

            <p>but: it is very difficult to understand.</p>

            <p>
            Whenever I read about PIE, I am bombarded by terms like
            <em>proterokinetic</em>, whatever that is meant to mean, and I do 
            not know of any easy explanations of Indo-European grammar in a 
            way that could say, actually help me to learn (what we know of) it.
            I just want an easy, point by point explanation.
            </p>

            <p>
            This is the reason I have created this subdomain. I wish to create
            a easy guide to PIE, by doing the academic reading myself (to help
            me get to a better understanding of it; my PIE knowledge is 
            woefully lacking) and creating the guide to PIE myself. I will 
            link any sources I use in the creation of this site.
            </p>

            <p>
            Please bear with me for now - this site is work in progress, and 
            sadly it might take a while for me to update this.
            </p>
