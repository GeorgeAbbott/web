            I decided to make a copy of Pokemon Ruby in Rust, and so set about 
            making a rough start. I decided to go with a "state stack" idea, 
            where each part of the game is managed with a state, and there is a 
            stack (or in my case, <code>Vec</code>) of states. Additionally, I 
            was using <code>ggez</code> library to help me. So in Rust, we 
            can create a trait for States:
            </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint align-left">
        trait State: ggez::graphics::Drawable {
            fn update(&amp;mut self, _ctx: &amp;Context);
        }
        </pre>

            <p>
            And then we can have a <code>Stack</code>, that just holds a <code>Vec</code>
            of <code>Stack</code>s and has a couple of functions for adding 
            and removing <code>State</code>s from the stack.
            </p>
            
            <pre class="prettyprint align-left">
            pub struct Stack {
                states: Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;
            }

            impl Stack {
                pub fn new() -> Stack {
                    Stack {
                        states: Vec::new(),
                    }
                }

                pub fn push_state(&mut self, state: Box&lt;dyn State&gt;) {
                    self.states.push(state);
                }

                pub fn pop_state(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {
                    self.states.pop().unwrap();
                }
            }
        </pre>

            <p>
            Simple right? And now just to implement two simple functions, the 
            <code><em>update()</em></code> and <code><em>draw()</em></code>
            functions, which should call the respective functions in the states:
            the draw() function should draw all the states from the first to 
            the last, and the update() function should <em>only</em> update the 
            very final state in the stack.
            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint align-left">
            impl State for Stack {
                fn update(&amp;mut self, ctx: &amp;Context) -&gt; GameResult&lt;()&gt; {
                    self.states
                        .last_mut()
                        .unwrap()
                        .update(ctx);
                }
            }

            impl Drawable for Stack {
                fn draw(&amp;self, ctx: &amp;mut Context, param: DrawParam) -&gt; GameResult&lt;()&gt; {
                    for state in &amp;self.states {
                        state.draw(ctx, param);
                    }
               }
            }
            </pre>

            <p>
            This was the code I initially came up with, and my idea was to 
            implement states as below, with a permanent reference to Stack - 
            of course, this needed to be a mutable reference, as we would need 
            the ability to add states. For example, consider the following 
            test code:
            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint align-left">
            /// A state that can be either Red or Blue.
            pub struct RbState {
                color: Color, 
                stack: &amp;mut Stack,
            }

            impl RbState {
                pub fn new() -&gt; RbState {
                    RbState {
                        color: Color::RED,
                    }
                }
            }

            impl State for RbState {
                fn update(&amp;mut self, _ctx: &amp;Context) -&gt; GameResult&lt;()&gt; {
                    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
                    let throw = rng.gen_range(0..12);

                    if throw &lt; 4 {
                        self.color == Color::BLUE;
                    } else if throw &lt; 8 {
                        self.color == Color::RED;
                    } else if throw &lt; 12 {
                        self.stack.push_state(Box::new(GreenState::new()));
                    }
                }
            }

            impl Drawable for RbState { ... }

            pub struct GreenState { ... }
            impl State for GreenState {
                fn update(&amp;mut self, _ctx: &amp;Context) -&gt; GameResult&lt;()&gt; {
                    
                
            </pre>

            <p>
            The above is obviously just test code, but in real code this might 
            be a TalkingToNpcState pushing a BattleState onto the stack, or 
            something like that.
            </p>

            <p>
            It became apparent to me pretty quickly that this obviously won't 
            work, so we need some kind of work around. And the first thing that 
            came to mind was: well why don't I try this <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>
            that I've heard a lot about? I heard this can allow for multiple 
            mutable references, so I could use this to get multiple mutable 
            references to my Stack, right?
            </p>

            </center><h2> The Problem with <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Stack&gt;&gt;</code></h2><center>
            <p>
            I unfortunately made a terrible mistake when trying to figure out 
            what <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> does, which is just figuring 
            it out from what people as opposed to actually reading the docs. I 
            went ahead and made all of my code <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>'ized.
            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint align-left">
            pub struct Stack {
                states: Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,
            }

            impl State for Stack {
                fn update(&amp;mut self, ctx: &amp;Context) -&gt; GameResult&lt;()&gt; {
                    self.states
                            .borrow_mut()
                            .update(ctx);
                }
            }

            pub struct RbState {
                color: Color, 
                stack: Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,
            }

            impl RbState {
                fn update(&amp;mut self, _ctx: &amp;Context) -&gt; GameResult&lt;()&gt; {
                    ... rest of the code ...
                    self.stack
                            .borrow_mut()
                            .push_state(Box::new(GreenState::new())
                }
            }   
            </pre>



            <p>
            And it didn't work.
            </p>

            <p>
            As it turns out, the interior mutability of RefCell doesn't let you 
            have multiple mutable references. It just derefs the checks to 
            runtime. So in the code above, it doesn't work because we have two 
            <code>borrow_mut()</code> calls - we need to make the first 
            <code>borrow_mut</code> because the call to update takes a mutable 
            reference, and we then need to call the second <code>borrow_mut</code>
            because we need a mutable reference to the stack to call <code><em>push_state</em></code>.
            </p>

            <p>
            So the RefCell solution will not work. I then came up with another 
            solution after sleeping on it - further solution TBA - what was it?
            </p>

            <p>
            TBA - after the solution from above TBA which did not work, then I 
            came up with the Option solution.
            </p>
