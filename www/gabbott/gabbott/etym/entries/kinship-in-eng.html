            This is a brief entry on various kinship words (words for family, 
            e.g. mother, father, brother, sister) in English. I will make 
            another similar entry on spousal terms, but across languages 
            instead, comparing how they are derived.
            </p>
            
        </center><h3>The Basic Kinship Terms</h3><center>
            <p> 
            It pains me to say, but the etymologies for basic kinship terms like 
            mother, father, brother, sister, son and daughter are very 
            simple. They have survived thousands of years from Proto-Indo-European
            with no change in meaning (because the meaning is so simple and has 
            no real reason to change). Because of this, if I am not careful I
            will just find myself going: <q>mother</q> is from PIE <em>méh₂tēr</em>, 
            which means <q>mother</q>, and so on and so forth for all other 
            kinship words. Because of this I will instead discuss possible 
            etymologies for these words in PIE, not just in English.

            <p>
            </p>
        </center><h3>Brother</h3><center>
            <!-- Mention brother -> brethren via umlaut/irregular plural
                 compare -en suffix with oxen, children, etc. -->
        </center><h3>Siblings</h3><center>
            <!-- Compare sib- element with gosSIP (from godsib) -->
