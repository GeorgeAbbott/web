			<header><h1> Religious Words </h1></header>

			<!-- Add content here in <p> blocks -->
            <!-- Begun writing 2021-11-17 -->

            <p>
            A thought popped into my head today: why do we say a person is 
            <em>Jewish</em>, but that their religion is <em>Judaism</em>? After
            all, whilst the <em>jew</em> and <em>juda</em> elements look 
            similar, they are definitely not the same, and from a first glance
            you cannot immediately tell the origin of them like you can with 
            <em>Christian</em> and <em>Christianity</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
            And similarly, a <em>muslim</em> is a believer in <em>Islam</em>.
            Hold on, these words are completely different! How is that the 
            case?
            </p>

            <p>
            That is the topic I will write about today - names of religions.
            It is late in the day though, so I won't go too deep.
            <p>

        </center><h2>Judaism</h2><center>
            <p> 
            Firstly let's go over Judaism. As it turns out the difference here
            is just a simple matter of being worn out over time, and the words
            ultimately derive from the same place, which is the name Judah. 
            Quite simple. 
            </p>

        </center><h2>Islam</h2><center>
            <p>
            The words <em>muslim</em> and <em>Islam</em> are quite a bit more 
            interesting. In Semitic languages (e.g. Arabic), instead of all 
            grammar being marked with affixes, instead roots of words are 
            sequences of consonants (e.g. k-t-b) into which vowels are slotted
            to mark grammatical information (for instance, the word 
            <em>kitab</em> means <q>book</q>, but the word <em>kutubiyy</em> 
            is a <q>bookseller</q>; the verb <em>kataba</em> means to write, 
            but if you conjugate it as <em>'aktuba</em>, it means 
            <q>I would write</q>. As can be seen from all these, the vowels are
            inserted into the words almost like a template: the -i-a- fits
            together with k-t-b to form <em>kitab</em> <q>book</q>. If you 
            want even more examples with this k-t-b root, there is an entire
            Wikipedia page dedicated to it, which you can 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-T-B">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Now, let's take the template for making a verbal noun, i--a- and 
            slot it over the verb s-l-m, meaning <em>to submit</em> (as in 
            to surrender oneself). We get the word <em>islam</em>.
            So <em>Islam</em> is the noun meaning <q>submission</q>.
            </p>

            <p>
            As for <em>muslim</em>, this has the prefix <em>m-</em> but works 
            in a similar way. It is actually the active particle of the verb 
            <em>'aslama</em>, again formed of the s-l-m root and meaning 
            <q>to submit</q>, so the word <em>muslim</em> translates to 
            <em>one who is submitting</em>. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Again there is a Wikipedia page dedicated to this particular 
            root (s-l-m), which you can find 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0-L-M">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            The exact origin of this kind of morphology, called
            <em>nonconcatenative morphology</em> is generally in a sort of 
            extreme kind of umlaut, which is then reanalysed and regularised
            into something resembling the above kind of morphology. Umlaut 
            itself generally occurs when strong sounds (generally vowels, such
            as /i/) affect the vowels around themselves. This is how in English
            we have many words where the plural is a difference in vowels, such
            as <em>foot, feet</em> or <em>man, men</em>. In these cases, the 
            suffix to mark the plural in West Germanic was an <em>i</em>, so
            the plural of <em>mann</em> was <em>manni</em>. This <em>i</em> was
            so strong it affected the <em>a</em>, turning the plural into 
            <em>menni</em>. From there, because the difference in vowels was
            enough to tell the difference between singular and plural, the 
            final <em>i</em> got dropped, giving <em>man</em> and 
            <em>men</em>. As said, the process to form morphology like in 
            Arabic is generally an extreme form of this umlaut, which is then 
            regularised to become the dominant paradigm.
            </p>

        </center><h2>Buddhism</h2><center>
            <p>
            Buddism is quite a simple one - the name comes from <em>buddha</em>
            , which is from the Sanskrit word <em>buddha</em>, meaning 
            <em>awakened</em> or <em>enlightened</em>. Tracing the word further
            back, it comes from a PIE word meaning <em>awake, aware</em>, which
            made it into English in the form of the words <em>bid</em> (as in,
            to bid at an auction) and <em>bode</em>. Hence, a word like 
            <em>forboding</em> comes from <em>forebode</em>, or being aware 
            (<em>bode</em>) of something in advance (<em>fore</em>, as in
            before).
            </p>

            <p>
            Another somewhat interesting thing about the word <em>buddha</em> 
            is the word for Buddha in several East Asian languages. For 
            instance, in Japanese, the word for Buddha is quite different:
            <em>Hotoke</em>, or <em>Hotoke-sama</em> with the honorific.
            This in turns comes from Old Japanese <em>potoke</em>, from 
            Proto-Korean most likely <em>*Pwutukye</em>. The <em>pwutu</em>
            comes from the same origin as Buddha, namely Sanskrit (albeit 
            through Chinese, which is partly responsible for the odd form). 
            The <em>kye</em> part is probably a similar honorific to Japanese 
            <em>sama</em>, meaning something like <q>lord</q>, but it might 
            also be from the Chinese word <em>ke</em>, or <q>spirit</q>, as in,
            the spirit of Buddha.
            </p>

        </center><h2>Sikhism and Hinduism</h2><center>
            <p>
            After this, the final two major religions, Hinduism and Sikhism, 
            have fairly simple etymologies that you may expect. Sikhism 
            naturally comes from <em>Sikh</em> comes from a word <em>sikkha</em>,
            which originally meant <q>teaching, instruction</q>, relating to a 
            word meaning <q>student</q>. <em>Hindu</em> is ultimate from the 
            same word where the word <em>India</em> came from, which is 
            <em>sindhu</em> in Sanskrit. This originally meant <q>river</q>, 
            and is relating to the Indus River. The <em>s</em> sound at the 
            beginning became <em>h</em> due to a common sound change, s > h, 
            and the word became <em>hindhu</em>. From here we get Hindu, and 
            when the word was passed along to Greek, the <em>h</em> at the 
            beginning was lost giving us <em>Indos</em>, or <em>India</em>.
            </p>

        </center><h2>Conclusion</h2><center>
            <p>
            Whilst this is only the etymology of the most common religions out 
            there, there are obviously many more. As you may have imagined, 
            names from religions tend to come from several sources, such as 
            names of important people in the religion (Judas in Judaism, Christ
            in Christianity, Buddha in Buddhism), descriptions of what followers
            should be like or do or descriptions of their leader ('submit' for 
            Islam, 'enlightened' as the description of Buddha) or the 
            nationality or geography (Hindu for instance). There are many other 
            smaller religions as well, each of which can have fairly 
            interesting etymologies as well (<em>Taoism</em> comes from a word
            meaning 'the way', where this <em>tao</em> element is related to
            the <em>to</em> in Shin<em>to</em>ism, which means 'the way of the 
            gods') but I have kept it to the major religions for brevity.
