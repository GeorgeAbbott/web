		<header><h1> About Me </h1></header>

        <p>
        This page gives some information about myself, and my hobbies and 
        interests.
        </p>

        <!-- TODO add info to these -->
        <h2>Programming </h2>
        <!-- DOS -> (Scratch) -> Python -> C# -> C++, Rust -->
        <!-- TODO: make it so these are hidden by default and seen with a dropdown -->
        <p>
        I first got interested in programming as a young teen, when I discovered
        cmd.exe on Windows, and realized that I could run commands on it to
        make the computer do cool things. I would probably spend most of my time
        running <code>echo</code> and <code>taskkill -F explorer.exe</code> -   <!-- todo verify I haven't messed up taskkill syntax -->
        I would kill explorer.exe, bring up a terminal and make it feel like I 
        was using MS-DOS. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Soon after in year 7 we had computer science classes and were
        introduced to Scratch (which I found a bit dull) and Python, which was
        incredible to me. I had been used to writing blocks of code in Batch 
        script using GOTOs, and then using more GOTOs to get me back to where I 
        was, so even the idea of a function was a massive help. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I kept on using Python all throughout my life and even up to A levels,
        but even at that point I was looking into other languages. I started 
        looking at C# for work experience and found it quite enjoyable and 
        began working with it where I could. 
        </p>

        <p> 
        In the past year or so I have gotten into Rust and started working a 
        little more with C++ as well. Both of these languages seem to be 
        interesting and Rust is very enjoyable to work with. C++ seems like a 
        bit of a mess, but I enjoy the syntax and where the language is going.
        </p>

        <p>
        By and large, software development has long since been one of my main
        interests, alongside languages below.
        </p>

        <h2> Languages </h2>

        <p>
        Also in my teen years I began studying German. I have family in Germany,
        but really as I never see them I am not really sure what the reason I 
        started learning was. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Either way, I found German very interesting and took to it quite well. 
        What I particularly enjoy is learning about grammar and syntax, less
        so vocabulary.
        </p>

        <p>
        Just after my GCSEs, I decided I wanted to learn another language as I
        had gotten to the point where my German was fairly good (my comprehension
        at least) and so I decided I would learn Norwegian and Polish. I spent 
        the most part of the two years of sixth form learning these languages,
        but eventually gave up the ghost as they just weren't grabbing me - 
        Norwegian was too easy and the grammar was rather boring, and I had 
        already learnt everything interesting in Polish grammar, and was faced
        with the realisation that to progress now would just be to bruteforce
        remember irregular forms (such as the numbers). I decided not to bother
        and so gave these languages up. That said, I still remember a fair bit 
        from both of them and can generally understand a fair bit of Norwegian
        (not as much Polish unfortunately).
        </p>

        <p>
        Then during sixth form, to skip out on having to study for exams, I 
        looked about and found Japanese. Japanese seemed very
        interesting - it was outside the European sprachbund so would have 
        an interesting grammar, it was strictly head-final (I am a big fan of 
        head-final languages), had a decently complex verbal morphology, etc. 
        As well as this, and the main reason I chose Japanese over another 
        language with similar characteristics such as Korean, Mongolian, 
        Turkish, Manchu, etc. was that I am a fan of anime and so would have a 
        decent amount of media I could watch.
        </p>

        <p>
        Really now, a couple years on, I think I appreciate Japanese even more 
        than the surface-level view I had of it when I went into learning it. 
        The languages feels incredibly expressive to me in a way that, much as 
        I do appreciate German, it simply isn't, and I enjoy the sound of 
        Japanese as well (not as beautiful-sounding as Norwegian, but close).
